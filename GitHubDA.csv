g3,ad sd,u,"auto-complete or show suggestions when tab is pressed in hub.It would be cool to auto-complete or show suggestions. For example: hub clone github/ + 2 * tab would list all the public repos of Github. And hub clone github/hu + tab would complete github/hub.It would be cool. However that would mean that your keystrokes would be triggering API requests and that you would have to wait for them to finish, making those autocompletions relatively slow? Are you sure this would be a good experience?.Yes, that's true. I think we should add a proper command for discovery..For example hub discover github would print all the repos of Github and store their names in cache for proper auto-completion:.discovery command would be great..So is anyone currently working on the discover command? If not, I can take it on! I'd really love that feature. Thanks :).Not to my knowledge. .Please explore how such a command could work. Note that our API library is go-octokit right now and that it might need contributing to as well to facilitate the feature of searching for repos..i'd love to help. .Let me know when you start working on it. Thanks.That'd be really great!. I just spent some time learning Go and went ahead and added the basic functionality of listing all the repos of a given user (isundaylee@df93604). We should probably discuss a bit about how we want to present the information, as well as possibly caching the information somewhere so that we can later reuse them for completion..So what information would we want in such a view? I'd assume repo name, # of forks, and # of stars. Anything else we might want?.Also do we have a standard way of outputting tabular output in hub?.I foresee that this shell completion feature would have two parts of implementation:.The shell script that works with bash/zsh/other completion features to fetch and display options after the user presses.1. The underlying command (proposed by @haikyuu) that would handle fetching this data and presenting it in machine-readable format (such as tab-delimited fields)..hi, did anything come of this discussion? i'd be keen on seeing this implemented. did you ever submit a pull request for this?

g4,ad sd,u,"All shadowed operators should have the same arities as their counterparts. #1104.Probably one of them got updated without the other:.We should check them all though..I noticed when I was reading hy.core.shadow this weekend that + demands an argument but * doesn't. That is, we provide the empty product but not the empty sum. I thought about it and realized that the problem with nullary + is that Python uses + for both addition and concatenation, so in a nullary context, we should return [], (), """", or 0, but we can't know which. It seems best to just disallow nullary +. So I think the shadowed version is right and the operator version is wrong..For /, there's again inconsistency between the operator (which returns 1.) and the shadowed version (which requires two arguments). It's not clear which is right, though. I'm leaning towards requiring the arguments, because although 1. is the only sane value for the ""empty quotient"", I can't think of a context where asking for an empty quotient wouldn't be a mistake..For -, the operator and shadowed version both require an argument, which seems fine, but not consistent with allowing nullary / if we decide to keep doing that..Here's what some other Lisps do for - and /:.In Clojure and Common Lisp, both - and / require an argument. Unary / is allowed, and returns the reciprocal..In Emacs Lisp, nullary - returns 0, but nullary / isn't allowed. Unary / returns its argument unchanged..I think we should follow Clojure and Common Lisp. (We already have unary / return the reciprocal.).You could make the same argument against *. It also works on strings, tuples, and lists:.In fact, any class can implement operators using dunder methods..I don't think that's a good reason to disallow nullary +. Look at what ClojureScript does:.I'm inclined to do things Clojure's way when Python doesn't object..The difference is that 1 is the identity element for both uses of * (multiplication and replication), whereas 0 isn't the identity element for concatenation..What do you think about the cases of - and /?.That's a fair point.  Maybe it could be a special case of 0 the same way false is. I'm not sure it's worth the trouble..But every Lisp I've asked says (+) is 0, including ClojureScript, which uses + for more than numbers. I think that's good enough. We could conceivably create an additive identity singleton that returns whatever it's added to and have (+) return that, similarly for (*). But then does it break when you use other operators that 0 understands?. Maybe it could be a special case of 0 the same way false is. I'm not sure it's worth the trouble..I don't know why nullary / is allowed in Hy. That doesn't really make sense. @kirbyfan64, was this a mistake when you added the unary reciprocal case I asked for? If so, we should probably remove the nullary case. If there's an argument for it I'd like to hear it, since it may also apply to -..Yeah, I think you've convinced me. Let's keep nullary + returning 0, and make the shadowed version consistent.",0.0  -0.1

However I found that if I explicitly include the include path to the llvm 33 directory containing its stdargh then all is well .blahcpp should add these lines .blahcpp should remove these lines .The full include list for blahcpp .Here it is with the additional include path .So this suggests to me that when building IWYU it isn't incorporating 'builtin' LLVM clang header paths somehow.Per the link posted earlier Clang searches for its builtin headers relative to the binary.I think the same rule applies for IWYU.This suggests you should move the include what you use executable to the same directory as clang or copy the builtin includes and libs from  opt local libexec llvm 33 lib clang 33 to just next to include what you use.I still can't repro here neither on Windows nor Ubuntu but I'm not sure what headers it finds and how.This is a bit of a problem with Clang I think that its header search algorithm depends on what platform it was built on.Note that if you build IWYU Clang and LLVM together this never becomes a problem because include what you use will end up next to clang in the install tree.I'd love to hear if you can get it to work by copying include and lib from clang 33 and then we can think about a more transparent solution.This applies to LLVM 35 in MacPorts as well.Doing a regular build with clang++ mp 35 shows no problem so it's iwyu related.For what it's worth I was running into the same problem with 34 and when I copied include what you use to the same directory as clang the problem went away.So it appears that the issue is caused by the headers that are shipped with clang not being resolved correctly when include what you use is located in a different directory.I ran this by the Clang development list and it seems we need to distribute the builtin headers with include what you use.Discussion here .http  clang developers42468n3nabblecom Standalone tools td4039043html.And this is actually mentioned in passing here .http  clangllvmorg docs LibToolinghtml#builtin includes.I'll try and update our packaging script to include Clang's builtin headers.Do you want to add Clang's builtin headers to the distributed archive or to bake headers into IWYU binary?.Since we have more than one build system I thought I'd add the builtin headers to the archive as a first step but ideally I'd like to bake the headers in.OK so I've experimented a little bit in my local Windows working copy.It seems that building a directory tree like this works reasonably well .I can copy this anywhere add the include what you use bin root to my path in a clean shell and it works.Does this look at all FHS friendly?.@sylvestre on CC  How does this match what you're doing for Debian?.I wonder if we should add the equivalent of a make install step?.Actually I am not sure how useful is a temporary fix by adding headers to distributed archives.At least people in this thread haven't complained about distributed IWYU binary they've built IWYU manually.I was thinking about creating a file containing baked in builtin headers with a Python script.Reasons for that  I am not very good with build systems; there will be less differences between different build systems.They're building out of tree and so run into the same problem    they can only get IWYU to work if they put it in the Clang bin root.But you're right; solving this in packaging won't help users building out of tree.Yeah a Python script sounds good we should be able to run it from both CMake and Make.The example from Olivier Goffart seemed pretty straightforward and should port to Python easily.I can build a draft implementation and we'll see how far it goes.I'm working on packaging IWYU for Fedora RHEL so it can be easily installed using the standard ""yum install"" process on those platforms.In that case the header files are already in the right place because both clang and IWYU are installed in the system directories.So if an option is added to copy package the headers as part of the install process then can an option to disable that please be added as well?.Kim that looks great. Under Debian I have clang installed here   usr lib llvm 35 lib clang 350 include.I've worked on embedding the headers but I can't get it to work properly.After convincing CMake to run the Python script I now get a compiler error from MSVC that the string literals are larger than 64K.Since some of the builtin headers are in the 3 500K range this seems hard to get around.I'll take a break from this and come back to it but ideas are welcome!.I just symlink the lib folder from my Clang install to a folder named lib where the iwyu binary would expect it and it finds the builtins that way.Is there any fix or work around which does not require root?.I don't have root access to my machine and I would like to use IWYU.I tried copying the folders from  usr lib64 clang 350 * to my iywu folder  but without success.The relative path distance between  usr bin clang and  usr lib clang <ver>  needs to be preserved so if you have the IWYU executable at ~ my iwyu folder include what you use the builtins need to be at ~ my iwyu folder  lib clang <ver> .Also <ver> needs to match the version IWYU was built for double check with `include what you use   version` which Clang version it's built against.I built iwyu 03 with clang 35 on Fedora 21 and this issue seems to be fixed.We haven't done anything actively so chances are you've installed iwyu into  usr bin.or built in tree with Clang or had the builtin headers available in the right place some other way.I'm not sure but I believe that this is a change in llvm clang because with IWYU 02 clang 34 I had to set up the relative paths to get the tests to pass but with 03 35 the tests pass without the relative paths.There has been zero progress on this issue for years.Is there a roadmap?.No definitive roadmap in sight.The problem is that the headers belong to Clang and if it's not installed the headers are not available.Furthermore if Clang is installed IWYU needs to either know where or be installed in the same place to be able to find them.So in a sense this is a packaging problem    an IWYU package should depend on the Clang package to ensure the headers are available.It also needs to install to the same bin path.I've experimented with embedding the headers into the binary see above but haven't found anything that's portable.A packager could maybe ship the headers with IWYU as well but then we risk conflicting with Clang's headers and that's probably not kosher solvable on all platforms.When building locally you could build the clang headers target which I think copies them into the right location relative your build root.Are these issues really all the same?.Which component hardcodes the search path?.In my case I'm building locally.Thus the path information is available during the build.Why can't this not be hardcoded?.I don't know much about clang tooling but even if the default search path can't be modified an extra include would fix the issue just as well.Something like an  isystem option.Good question.I'm not sure if they're all the same.The search path for builtins appears to be called the ""resource dir"" and its default is hard coded by the Clang Frontend library to point to some approximation of dirnameargv[0]  lib clang <version> see https  githubcom llvm mirror clang blob master lib Frontend CompilerInvocationcpp#L1693.But there also seems to be a switch  resource dir to override this default.If we could ship the builtin headers with IWYU and install them to a known location we could make  resource dir point to that location something like $iwyu bin  share clang headers.I still think there may be challenges with platforms like Windows where there's no Filesystem Hierarchy Standard to speak of but this might be a way forward.Does this sound like a way forward?.That sounds doable!.On the other hand I'm wondering whether iwyu should control this at all.There are only a few principle ways iwyu is being invoked.Through iwyu tool on a shell or through CMake.Why not try to Do The Right Thing in these specific cases but make it overridable through a resource dir option?.Doing the right thing means guessing the resource directory In particular .iwyu tool  The compilation database contains compiler binary.From that we can determine the location of the headers.shell  Not sure what the right thing here is.We can try to guess the correct path by looking for usual suspect compilers.CMake  Here we'll need some help from CMake which again knows the correct compiler.So it can supply a guess for the  resource dir option.I know nothing about clang on windows however.I think one challenge is that IWYU is tightly tied to a specific Clang version namely the one it was built with.The builtin headers are revision locked with the compiler source code.So the compiler usually used to compile the user source the one provided in compile commandsjson is not necessarily the same version as IWYU's base compiler.Typically it's not even Clang.True I didn't consider this.You can't really swap out intrinsic headers and expect things to go over smoothly.That leaves us only with shipping the headers.This makes packaging and distribution slightly more involved but not impossible.Something like $PREFIX share iwyu include seems to be an appropriate location at least for linuxoid systems.Unfortunately the clang resource dir is not exported by clang's CMake.So again we can only make guesses.We could probably submit a patch to upstream though to export this.posted a patch for the upstream exposure here  https  reviewsllvmorg D49486.Thanks!.To come back to the potential solution I think it comes down to .As a build step copy the resource dir into the IWYU build tree  $BUILD share iwyu include.Change the current output path for include what you use to $BUILD bin include what you use rationale later.Add a CMake install rule to copy them to the install tree at $PREFIX share iwyu include.Have IWYU set Clang's resource dir to dirnameiwyu binary  share iwyu include which is pretty much what Clang does I think.By building directly to bin  it becomes possible to run IWYU directly from the build dir after build especially if there's some kind of order dependency for copying the headers.Does that sound about right?.As someone who's struggled off and on to provide usable IWYU packaging in Homebrew for several years it's either ""build the world"" or ""hackily symlink to Xcode's included headers and break during its upgrades"" if we get to a place where I canÃ¢â¬Â¦.Depend on clang in Homebrew in a way it produces the header files for IWYU's use.Have IWYU put these in a well known place share is fine.Let IWYU look for them here possibly even override this with a configure or CMake variable so I can tweak it if things aren't entirely compatible?.Ã¢â¬Â¦ then I will be very happy and packaging this in the future becomes much much easier.My plan was roughly this .Add a IWYU RESOURCE DIR cmake cache which defaults to CLANG RESOURCE DIR.If they end up being unequal install the entire CLANG RESOURCE DIR into IWYU RESOURCE DIR This allows distinguishing behavior between building installing and packaging!.Export IWYU RESOURCE DIR to the implementation and plug it as a system header include path into the CompilerInstance.I'll cobble this together and paste a link!.Here it is  pfaffe include what you use@f4732dbeb2696266d60b97365630d4c099c47ba1.Currently this doesn't handle the difference between an install tree and a build tree correctly.This I'll have to figure out yet.If IWYU RESOURCE DIR manually set eg to share include what you use that directory doesn't mean anything in the build tree and becomes valid only after install.In this case we'd have to fall back to CLANG RESOURCE DIR.Not sure if cmake supports this nicely.Cool!.So IWYU RESOURCE DIR is always relative then?.That way the path gymnastics in iwyucc works out in the installed tree at runtime which is a prerequisite for binary packages eg for Windows.Yeah the build vs install tree was what I had planned to work around by brute force copying the clang headers into the build tree if necessary but that's pretty ugly.Or we could symlink them into the build tree except that doesn't work on Windows but I guess CMake falls back on copy.It doesn't have to be relative.The default is equal to clang's CLANG RESOURCE DIR which is most likely absolute Is this an issue on windows?.Copying works but it really is ugly.Maybe we can instead add both IWYU RESOURCE DIR and CLANG RESOURCE DIR as system include paths but let IWYU take precedence.That way if IWYU is set to something that points into the void as it'd likely be in a build tree if it's set we'd fall back to CLANG at runtime.I can imagine it would be if there's a hard coded absolute path compiled into IWYU.On Windows the natural ""packaging"" paradigm is to build a GUI installer often from a toolkit.The installer contains all files in an unrooted tree sort of like a tar archive.The first thing a GUI installer typically prompts for is the install root similar to the prefix but Windows installers can write files anywhere they like on the disk.The default here would be something like C \Program Files\include what you use but I might elect to install IWYU into F 	emp\include what you use.So the install root can not be fixed at configure time it needs to be resolved at runtime.I'm not sure how stuff like this works in the Unix world    I haven't had a chance to get acquainted with any packaging system    can you not override the prefix for a package when installing it?.Also why system include path rather than  resource dir?.In Linux install behaves the same.It didn't seem like i can properly pass the resource dir into the tools.And there is only one resource dir so the fallback thing wouldn't work in that case.In Linux install behaves the same.In that case I don't understand how hard wiring an absolute path decided at configure time can work.And there is only one resource dir so the fallback thing wouldn't work in that case.Ah hm.I think it would make sense to make the fallback unnecessary but yeah until then  isystem should be equivalent.In that case I don't understand how hard wiring an absolute path decided at configure time can work.That only makes sense if at configure time the path of the clang resources is know.Otherwise you can just specify a relative directory.The relative directory will then be relative to the install prefix.OK so if the IWYU package being built uses the same default install prefix as the user installing IWYU this will work.And I guess that's the typical scenario.But in all other corner cases it will fail eg user overriding install prefix packager building with a non standard prefix user doesn't have clang installed Windows [not really a corner case but yeah  ].So it seems better to me to just always bundle the headers with IWYU.Or maybe it's a build flag    IWYU BUNDLE BUILTIN HEADERS    so that packagers can choose to bundle them but lowly people like myself can just run IWYU from the build tree with the clang resource dir path compiled in.Let me clarfiy how I expected this to be used .Use case a  If you build IWYU for yourself ie you have the clang sources or at least headers around and don't install or 'presist' the build anyhow you just leave IWYU RESOURCE DIR alone and everything will just work as you'd expect.At runtmie iwyu picks up the headers that belong to the clang you used during build.Use case b  If you build IWYU for distribution ie packaging or local installation you set IWYU RESOURCE DIR to a relative path.As result the resource headers will be copied into the bundle and picked up from there at runtime.In my hacky implementation there are two caveats wrt the uses cases .What if you don't want to bundle the headers but just have them in a weird location?.You'd want to set IWYU RESOURCE DIR but not copy anything anywhere.This also is when you'd set the dir to an absolute path.A seperate BUNDLE option like you suggested would fix that.The divergence between build tree and install tree behavior we discussed above.This can be fixed by using the fallback onto CLANG RESOURCE DIR.As noted inÂ #827 the builtin headers are now copied to the build dir under all configurations That solves this issueÂ whenÂ include what you useÂ is executed from the build tree which is not the case most of the time.Next step should be to also install the headers together with IWYU It's been quite some time since I investigated this but I seem to recall there's noÂ straightforwardÂ way to override Clang's idea of where the builtin headers should be But there might be a more or less hacky way to do it.I think there are a number of increments to this .So TL;DR; not sure what the next step is Needs more investigation and thinking which requires more time of which I don't have much right now",0.0

Therefore it cannot find the necessary dependencies and I'll run into a fatal error uponÂ build.Â Yes one way to solve this is to physically put the dependencies within the R package. That does defeat the purpose of submodules though which are very useful..It appears using the following argument works:.The problem with this is this isn't default behavior.

One workflow from private -> public in ITERATIVE mode. You probably want to use --ignore-noop. Throw away this workflow once the initial import is done..2. Once you have public ready, make public SoT (For public part of the repo).3. Create an ITERATIVE or SQUASH workflow from public -> private. git.origin -> git.destination.

Configure an internal to external workflow using CHANGE_REQUEST mode. use git.github_pr_origin to git.github_pr_destination. You don't submit in the the internal repo.
