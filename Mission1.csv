Corning. 8. Larry Smith. 40. funny. 8.I have a problem I can. I have a problem I can't resize Minecraft.yeah I can't either.do you plant. In her window. window. well what are the resolutions then or a third of the screen. yes.mute for me once I change the resolution I was able to change the window size once at launch.for me to 2560 X 1440 but I have a really big monitor so I just sent it to the max for my mom. all right here let me see if. I can. installations this. take it said it too.alright Minecraft is loading. it still won't let me resize it but. it's just ever so slightly more than a third of my screen. probably slightly smaller okay I'll do that. I wonder why we can't resize it.yeah I got none. I mean I can just use this window. Ace is big enough for me to use raise hand raised and raised. alright I'm going to head to the right and just check everywhere over there if I find anybody.I'm red I'm just. if I find anybody I'll bring them back with me.I'm right I'm just going to open areas for now.this is.do I say we pick 3 in front of rooms that are cleared to buy a critical people and one in front of the dangerous room.alright that sounds good. let's see I'm going to guess at the bottom is the entrance so they're there and this room is clear. and then the debreeze. this room is clear. and every room branching off of it is also clear let's see. buffets. 1 is.I am not going to go to the same room I found one I'm right by the way. thanks Brad. buffet buffet buffet. is it difficult. I'm going to go ahead and change into heavy so I can start breaking some of the gravel and we'll be able to get the people. oh by the way I'm green this is weird having to say who you are before you speak.is bread I also agree.caring people in front and I'm also focusing a lot on Mockingbird. this is green when you mark a room is clear can you also shut the door. mysterious one. this is. this is green I just went into the. angel room and now I am stuck I have made a critical mistake. and. and I'm waiting for assistance s was a very bad mistake since I already cleared this room you're able to come in here and. I break the the Survivor blocks or whatever they are I forgot what they're called. I can fill with the door. thank you.this is red I'm going back to change roles to my tools almost broken do we have a specific role that we need. not that I can tell.this is going to be surgery because I have Medicare now. I'm going to preemptively put three tiles over that room that we're just in. Frances green. all right entrance go up the hall a little goat.left found that this and we are at Route 101 it's MP3. 1. groom. 109. guy trapped in rubble. you got them right behind you all right this one is clear. rooms clear. oh I got an idea. if you know for a fact there's someone in a room and you need the heavy. speaking about that I found a critical person there in room 108 let me check real quick yes I'll room 107. it's a little to the left of the entrance.okay. We want to go to the. to the left do you meet us out here. I guess. hello. okay. all right.The Walking Dead. all right 7 all right. that down 6 is. clear. 5 is. there's a person in room number 105. is red B need me to bring them out for. at least you can if you'd like us screen I'm just checking all of these room numbers 100. there's another one in the Next Room number 104. 103 there is. and then there's a another person in the Next Room over Number 103. practically stapler I have a critical victim and also a danger room. where is the critical victim. can you go back to the entrance and I can walk over. alright I'm a little slow since I'm heavy. also I'm going to change to scout right after we do that so I can start picking up these people because he is doing a lot worse than I thought it would. dihybrid. very slow this sucks. well I'm only ever so slightly as.somebody. at the danger room is right here I'm residential rooms right here okay. read when he's scratching I'm ever so slightly faster LOL go in all right there's a guy there's there's one person. and the critical victim is back here. and he's blue..look at this place.this is green I'm going back to base his base this way.a basis the other way through the courts. okay. do now that I think about it. Searchers a little Associates just to scout out rooms really I mean if you find somebody you can use the splint to grab them but. mostly medic and heavy are the useful things. cuz when you're mad at you can just be at the room and he'll them immediately when you're heavy you can clear out the stuff for the medic to come.like I said somebody. this is green so I've decided I'm going to be a medic instead.I believe we have a majority of stuff bodies. hey we have a 18 out of 50 and 1 critical. definitely realize that sidebar. I'm going to. and classes I can't find any more people. hi this is green I'm at the back of the building just trying to find anybody else. is so far it's been pretty good there's nothing that way. where is this this is looking they're just what they're I'm here I went over to at.This Is Us. I would you like me to go it's just green would you like me to go get the. heavy I'll go grab the heavy real quick. is Fred I am the heavy we also have around 3 minutes left and 1/2 minutes. green. oh come here take you were just looking at me I'm green all right go behind me there's a pile of rubble right over here with a person in it I think. here in the middle. going to break open on the side. okay. take me to go ahead and check the other files if you'd like. will do. alright heavy there's a all right.towards the back of the building you were just here if you take a right going from the front entrance. and keep on going there's a blue building there's a guy being blocked by Rubble. oh where.this is blue I just want a critical. all right I'll be there in a sec. so you read.we want to you want me to break down the umbrella do you want me to break down the wall or. I just come to me because we don't have much time left.okay. I'm coming. oh I also just found a critical. the Fred you think it'd be faster if I change classes before I run to the blue or to their critical. I don't know here come here come here if no it's right over here. oh it's over here oh I'm sorry that was on the other side. over in. over here. all right. is below ground. if you want we could probably go and start recipe for orzo lunch from. Alice hallway I remember I don't know if anyone got those yet. is there anybody in this in those gravel things. I will check this out real quick. it's not on there. I found somebody. is running better quickly try and swap glasses. all right now we have gotten the majority of everybody. is resurrecting somebody now and also a couch.glad I think that was the strategy.yes

Smithfield.and there this is Graham there is a child be standing by his door lock on it. and this is also a dream there is a red room here. I need help. when was the medicine. I'm done with my area. where would you like me to switch to Medic or did you not go in the room yet. we can probably do that later. when will I switch to medic I'm done with my section I am marked all the rooms. all right yeah this is red I believe right is clear of gravel that is obstructing path so I think we are good to move on. is blue I am putting. and there is a victim. all the victims by here. and there was a cripple if it come on my land. or in the back. I just read where is it from the green. a promark drone Sniper 3 marker on the critical victim all in the back. this is blue I will be putting my markers on over yours wherever I've already been in. show me more of the movements of the. this is green this is Red Sox so we can just go ahead and stabilize it. set alarm clock. Church Street. no are we on the map right now so not.

I can do it if y'all play. occupations rooms.is blue I think once we've owned. act out most of putting most of the victims on by the front one person can switch the medic and then if we need more people on it towards the end we can switch to more than one person kinetic. this is a green is a critical person on me. is red where is that. Star Market on Lemon and blue on the left side. room 107. 7. can you give me like a room number or a real name. 107. hey I'm on my way to stabilize it and Rescue It. are this is red also green if you want to start doing any of the danger rooms. is there an early spring is there any danger rooms around here. I want somewhere but I don't. Olympic going if I see one. another was born on February. this is red turns out they do not stay stabilized so if you want to come to 102 we need to reschedule Isis.

I'm on my way. this is right I've gone back and I'm stable or I'm rescuing the critical in storage G.I'm now heading to the front to stabilizing some of the ones we have there. so if someone wants to come in storage C and stuff in there at the danger room.Tupelo do that.listen to green board you want to do that since you're the fastest.

What restaurants are twos I have been using for victims and 140 victims. I was just going to add another critical in room 103. that is why do all the same interactions mean. this is blue it looks like on the interaction pain for me it says no victim is to. I'd rather fight than dressing that's what it seems like we have different one so we should probably just have a standard I guess. this is bliven marking according to my interaction pain so I guess for red we'll just say that yours your twos are victims right.I'm there. all right got to choose our victims through these are critical using 3.what is green I'm just moving the victim's I see in the hallway to the obvious place I'm using two's four rooms that are empties and threes for criticals.this is red actually intraday.does blue I go back and change the medic so I can help you. how to set screen up searched the entire left side of the map from the number two rooms all the way to the left. is blue what's your location.has any red I'm in the northwest. that's what I like from twos writing for the doorway in the body was able to. this is right I hear someone.

Makita razor. all right though. yeah that's enough something happened to me. is it the climate does not able to be configured. it is the horizontal scroll. you should be able to restart Minecraft and it will most likely work. it's not mine.so you're not able to just manually resize the client map.okay. what are able to revive it to one-third of my screen and use the plus and minus key do Zoom differently inside the window up if you want to make it fit a little better. does that work.this is Reggie. any other issues I'm not able to resize the Minecraft where you close Minecraft down completely and then bring it back up are my screen. I know we prefer you not to share screen but have you checked the resolution for your Minecraft in my feet. so high for your.can you. but you might want to lower your resolution that might be able to solve the problem. okay. are you able to see where your resolution is for your Minecraft world.this is Drake Jewish.and I have this one. once once I go to the single-player and multiplayer screen United I'm not able to adjust a size. give me suggestions. I'm just playing Minecraft to see if I can see what's going on here.you can follow me. try calling full screen on and off through the actual Minecraft graphic interface do when you go to auctions there.I think there's nothing over there so we can mourn. we had a couple participants have issues and they just started playing with a few of the settings and it was able to just start working so. we're able to my adjust the screen. I know and it's loading still loading. yes no one will do that.thank you.this is where the fuel economy. yes I'm good.

And then back and then I lost the ability to resize so I have to close out of the client and rejoin. do you like this I don't know I tried to put it at school and then I lost ability trees ice so I have to close out of the client and rejoice. that's very odd I've never seen that before. are you when you start moving around are you able to function okay.

I feel like yes okay. I'm not sure but I feel like I feel like you can I feel like you can I'm going to take the risk and then if you come back out there's another danger room that is towards this direction that we could clear out as well. there's a regular right there towards the left and then a regular right here as well. oh shoot I'm the one. oh did you get it did you get the injured I don't know Carol.. yes. and I can't do it. I should be able to go back I should be able to go back in time. yeah that's right. of course I'm the slowest class in the game but took a.this is blue I'm just going to run and get the feel like I'm going to live so anyone that I found it was going to grab him. yeah. okay this is green I am in.

I'm going on the right side corridor.Alice blue looks like we don't have a malicious we've got two medics. hey yeah this is green we should have the money to become the engineer.this is rad I can go do that. call been seeing a lot of rubble throughout the entirety of the building. it seems it seems like a lot of them are going to be trapped under Rubble instead of just out in the open like on the practice. Thunder going to go through go through all the buildings and see if there are any exposed but so far it's looking like not. iPhone 1.it was blue and moving them to the sort of Central Central hallways I find them. fantastic thank you mrs. green.

I'm sorry where do we spawn though I can't see on the map. are you. so we see that the doctor area is another thread we have a good look on the white part I say we take such such as move the victims to run American get on it and once we have the regular victims we can speed up the healing. and there's just a lot of people everywhere especially the face.this is Lil you just wanting like like outside of the map itself there's just that big hallway and also I believe in the break room near like the inner left of the map there is a lot of rubble Plus in between that break room and the data storage where that room is a threat room so I'm going to go ahead and switch to Rebel clearance. if I see any victims and bring them to the hallway. we're not getting it also. computer room searched.it's best that we should just go ahead and clear all the rubble first and then if we encounter any victims along the way then we can just switch out there. yeah I'm still at Scott right now and like moving people. we can also do the same street by room so if you if we know that the room is cleared. yeah go ahead and do that. this is right if he can be consistent into the hallway. question about the trappings and when I open the door when I walk in. yeah yeah I'll just go ahead and clear the rubble that I saw him there on and then proceed on that left side like we see on the map. ssj blue found a victim just outside data storage in the middle between that in the break room.I found another victim.I have a critical in room 107.green Hocking who found the victim and where. search a place Marker 1. this is blue find another victim in the break room. okay I'll head there right now.

Russell only have 10 like 10 ish minutes. I know I'm I'm still on the heavy but once okay yeah. again. this is what I have an issue I can't pick up the victim. what is 7 got it. hello Scout. Republic at the critical first in 107. this isn't the Metro. how many Medics I'm at 1 to 7. I'm not going to swim with one baby inside. and I'm not sure why I can't move. and my sledgehammer is almost done so once I'm done with that will go ahead I'll go ahead and fix the medic. don't worry little buddy. cereal. all right. all right. do you mean my phone browser. this is why I'm going back out the base to switch. what you say run. I think we would need more medic at this time because we've already got a backlog of regulars in the main entrance. how to say green hair I say go for heavy is really all kinds of trouble trouble and I can just like start going through the pile. like which victim quotes problem. alright so. this is blue I'm just going to switch to medic for the time being. we are able to mark the map. how do you do that. yeah I know how to Market I don't see any updates on that either it's just a regular meatball. nope.big J.I don't think we can actually do that at least like Mark the actual map but of course we can just go ahead and.is a map in Minecraft. yeah yeah I see it. what Mark Mark the Minecraft maps. okay yeah. no no no no I'm I'm talking about the actual Minecraft not the one that were walking around him as opposed to the. yeah map of the client. an infraction paint it says regular vacuum is 1 + 3. tell if a room is safe. stream 1003 on my browser. really heavy right now. storage h. Bartlett actually this is the littlest actually start using the markers so the conference room has no victims wall the Herbalife 1011 Mary-Kate oh my things are all in the Mary Kay conference room is a front room so I might be in love lives just letting you guys know just in case. okay not mobilised going to the victim in this room. as a general rule of thumb. all right. just got to mobilize trying to get out of the Mary Kay room. this red I'm a heavy dough. yeah that's off to the left hand side like right opposite room 107. Asian real-time everyman's clear how do we plant the three marker on the floor in front of it. I'm a heavy, heavy. I see a normal over here at the market. no but seeing the interaction pain that says no victim here regular victim here critical victim here so we put a one there instead of at 3. this is when I just want to confirm blue one two three. no. oh okay. what do you see the code says if you see one as regular with the marker. wow okay. find the critical. read you got that mixed up with no victim is one regular victim is too critical victim is 3 and I'm still waiting in the entrance of Mary Kay just trying to I am a mobile I so I can be of any help right now. I'm in storage H this critical. oh okay I thought you said. set this why I'm going to stop Dometic so we can just find Rick and lotto and rescue them. all right but somebody's going to have to get me out of here cuz I'm in mobilized. Michigan time. yeah right in the entrance of Mary Kay I'm right there immobilized. on the left or right side of neck. okay see it coming I'm ready. left. derrigo. going to actually have to wear when you're going to actually have to heal me first I think. oh you're okay. are you okay are you a list. I don't know how to heal you. I see one as no victim to as regular victim three as critical victim. I was manic. yeah I'm in mobilized best thing. so you have to go back and get the medikit. what no it looks it looks like you have the structure so you're a searcher. I'm going to get there. yeah least that's how it looks like to me.for you so I can systematic and go res the other person blue take time.it's a mystery to me. storage break room is over here.yeah. I see a normal. plus we don't really have many victims saved and it's only like 4 minutes left. if your digits on points I know where critical is. this is red blue green are you at are you still in the breakroom. I thought my Quicken. storage one. oh yeah we can we can just get to the credit goes first. there is one over and. all right thank you and where the criticals. the break room I think those big room. is there evidence of a crime inside the storage. yes yes. break room now it's not right here somewhere in the right side somewhere over here. no I already did and do you just hear me. I just got two normals. I am a mobile ice right now. Arenas in. the coffee shop I think. address of blue-green where are you. I'm not storage one. okay. Sarge. critical person. Davis storage you sent or just trying to get okay. I see you read yeah I'm coming with you. I'm not sure if it's a regular one so I'm not going to answer because if I enter there's a possibility I might have been in. no but the rule said that only only if somebody already got immobilized and that means set. me to have a bird with the house. okay I don't have Matthew what is going on with the markets cuz it's just wrong recorded for each of us. what there isn't going to be any more mobilization and didn't say if somebody didn't get immobilize then station. alright I'm coming back out to get you or you're at you're at the Datacenter right. all right. bird. okay. next time we should definitely like you would like Scout and heavy and then one medic that goes like together and then great Scott and heavy together and then let it just goes around. it seems like the Scout can't do much cuz there's a lot of gravel and. should I. I like have you can kind of like do a line for the whole place cream stuff in the Scot will moving to a better location for the medic.yeah.at 22 seconds. I guess I need to start looking at the markings on the map. right we didn't do good this time but at least we learned of it.no I thought it was my bad I didn't notice I had a victim on me. are you there. is. did one of the mods just like teleport me. cuz I just got glitched at the map and fell from Feldon. at Adesa is circulation or is it durable. I think that was a command block. yeah so does the events trigger when I open the door when I walk in. a question. does the tooth break right like medkits and stretchers. okay. if it breaks Lego Sim heavy and it breaks do I go back to normal speed or heavy speed. but you're my soul heavy. we talked about"

I told you. Ryan. identity parents chocolate. Showbox. it looks like everyone's back. Italian can I confirm that the pasta is ready to go. okay participants before we moved to Mission to please go to your client and click on the open survey drop-down menu and finish survey section titled mission to prep.Ronald McDonald.this is green I'll be a medic obviously we did pretty decent last time but I definitely think we can do better this time probably get an actual strategy going. so if you're going to run stretcher read what I said maybe suggest it said due to you having a higher speed to maybe just try to go through the roots are like areas play sound the like markers on if you find any victims or if you don't find any victims that way it's kind of easier for me to know if I should just skip a room or if I should just like go for it I guess I'll probably skip out dangerous rooms for now cuz it's almost a guarantee that you're just going to get injured so I must you have like me by Youth and there's just no real point in going in there cuz you're just going to get stuff for a bit. so I mean that's what I'm thinking of anyone want to add on to that and I think probably near the house Waypoint or something I've see we want a party for Tice team score so we should probably get her switch to double our Medics maybe even triple if you want to gamble it.this is a green blue I still got a critical victim and we need to grab real quick. which is great and bread for a get-together she did come back till 1 or 7. mrs. green red you just like you are doing that's a great idea. and we're running up to just so yeah just keep put them outside in the hallway so due to the easy for me to say that's a good idea.Susie Greene.word when the unknown area right now right. this is great all right. Say the same as general clear on where also. sorry about. looks like we're kind of fitting that halfway point so if you want to switch up the team composition. this is great so I without a doubt the pretty sure there are people stuck behind. trouble but I mean you're pretty fortunate you are kind of slow so I'm not sure how useful it is maybe just switched a medic or a Searcher for now whatever you think it's probably best and then just start healing victims are bringing them out and it's always and then won't let's just look at covering the rest of the building. this is green sounds like a great idea I said looks like the left side is Chumlee covered there are some dangerous rooms that have yet to be asked what we should probably call the same goes for last. the suspect left side which seems to be the big patch of unknown are you going to say that's where we found her just were so let's just move move over to like the middle spot other building. this is green actually I'm a try to switch to a Searcher or Scout real quick before work so I'm going to try and see if we can get a spin if it comes outside. screwing I am on my way.this is green we have a critical viscum at storage t.disagreed right behind you.and this is Graeme I fell asleep like we got around a minute left.this is screen mom currently by the library

I was going to say you should probably stay specialist just in case we get disconnected like last time so you can quickly run back up to where we are. and then maybe green2go engineer what are you getting off work. are you stay is a searcher.I was just green I'm going to Mark a critical real quick but we can go ahead and stop by later. Isabel right. this is green storage Ruel should all be clear I'm going to check the other opposite ends I'll let you guys know if I find anything. this is blue sew in the in L there wasn't any trouble for this. hear what this is green there was some Rubble for the most part though. it all looks clear but we can go through it once. this is sorry I'm hungry we can go through it once everything is kind of just had a Sprint through real quick if that's okay. that's fine I was just wondering. screen I'm marking another critical far far end. visibly what's the nearest call out on the client map. story not storage am I the one to the right of that I can't. I can't see it without scrolling sorry. Birthright. this is the green everything on the right side of the map should be clear at least everything we can get to without an engineer. alright Green do you want to maybe go to engineer now so we can clear out the bright side the parts with rubble. ice cream guy that sounds good to me.this is green blue do you want or not blue I'm sorry red do you want to switch to engineer with me that way we can clear it out a little bit faster. this is green there's a couple criticals over there too I have them marked but we should probably stick together for the most part one while we clear out the right side.the blue I'm just refresh my tool since it was pretty low if we're going to go towards the right and certainly never could you also take us to where the critical czar. this is green yeah whenever we go down each all we should be able to see the three markers going down them. all right. West Greene there's no one back there.would you want to check the star room is someone in there and I can be ready.the blue all right. scream I'm going to leave at 2 out here just so that way we can come back and move that body in case there's anyone behind it. I'm going to put someone's outside of the cleared rooms. blue that's a good idea. this is green red can you meet us in storage G. istorage g there's a critical in here. is booyah. we're here you see me. all right got it. this is green I'm moving over to the opposite side now. is a blue wolf shops inside the west side of the map. this is green my apologies side ponm. Blue Ruin.the blue on living room to Landmark.if trouble that we can check yet.screen what what what area was that. vroom. 101.this is green I am on the east side wall. Ivy storage room so storage you. I'm is my nearby room. the blue I'm in room 106. sprained all the rebel is cleared on the storage side I'm going to go switch my class real quick you guys want me to go Searcher and just bring the bodies closer to the front or should I go medical just go ahead and get started on healing them. this is blue I'm already about there so you could go searcher. this is green we probably still need one for the room side. do you want to just have that right now about how much Rubble is there on the. left side or the room side I'm sorry. on the recorder with rims that are about two or three. only a few minutes and a half so if you find a critical let's get that first. I think I'll start speak. it's all right. this is green yeah Mark sorry I forgot to mention that are the other storage rooms cleared out. yeah I got to read this is Luke where you at. read can you come here.Sports.these priests right outside. this is green I'm going to run over to the room side and grab as many bodies as I can. this is blue sounds like a good idea. play where are you going to try and bring them. this is green I'm just going to bring him up to the front try and meet you in the middle. I can't get anymore oh well
