I awesome so I guess we can kind of make this area where the one is kind of our point every convenience and if so I'm going to head down this Hall to the right side by the way towards the storage units at least that's what I'm seeing on the map on the client..anything for me and let me know. all right. yeah let's this is great now let's yeah. awesome and.yeah this is where do we start on a map. this is right I think we are if you see the lobby I think we're right in lobby. okay. could I see like Dumbledore Cana things towards the bottom and I think that's us so so I guess I'll just kind of meat back in this area I'm going to go towards store and try to see what I can find. cool.I'm rescuing one person right now. okay I am this is green.I'm going to start with the middle hallway and just start looking. that's a great question. this is red in storage if you go through it there's a storage room on the other side there's a regular victim behind some Rebels that I can't access I put a marker on the front of the door. yes. okay. yes I just ran I'm on my way. okay.Rebecca this is blue what was the official said you put the marker down for the via phone. this is green in these double doors are here blue is a person. this is green there is a critical victim in this Birch room. this is red the one that I found was the markers outside storage he's yet there's Rubble that needs to be picked up mine I guess I just picked up that really called.the glue in this is second time this happened where I fully healed someone and then it just reset it happens or if it's a glitch with the system but I just want to say out loud for the.Tears of the Sun. okay this is Greek could you are you close to Sun dollars coffee cuz there's a critical make them right here okay cool. your. this is right I'm about to enter a room that is a danger room at storage G in case I go down down here at the end of this hallway and green right here in this door right here she goes through their struggle with a regular behind it.

I've been injured if you go into the room blue. okay.is philosophy right now. area. is right I'm going to continue going down to the right. okay. this is right up ahead.hey this is Lou Gramm cuz she's where did you say The Prestige of sleep was.or not..call ND. yeah this is right I took that regular victim and brought them outside to you blew just touching up. this is green the one room with me one in front of it has a. I cleared regular victim inside. this is red I'm at storage all right now but a regular victim out over there I think there is one in this Rubble according to the map that we have I'm putting a one marker in front of the door. I indeed this is green and the doorway.we're in the same or sorry this is blue we were in the hallway. Had like Ellen K & J and autos.red one and then through the second door. oh nevermind. okay. okay and then this is green there is one regular victim in storage room G I put a to marker outside. this is random in the furthest most right hallway where it's like Teru and I have two regular victims and I think I'm about to enter a room that has maybe two or three of them as well but it is a dangerous I am prone to being injured just a heads up.I disagree on the outside I got you. I have been injured unfortunately. is William Russia's person in the savior. oh this is Greenbrier you guys. and I words. thank you. okay. gotcha this is green blue there is a regular victim over this corner behind the. then green if you want if either one of you have the time this is red in the storage room key I'm not mistaken there is a regular trapped in the rubble pile for this right Rubble pile when you went to the doorway. and I also know the same hallway there's like some Rubble piles kind of in the middle of the hallway or like there's one that's in the middle the hallway I'm putting a marker on it I think there's somebody in there when I hear Bluetooth. I should be all of the sword is good for now I could be wrong actually. sword room which one. that's why I put one down there blue I just found him. call this is what I'm asking, then I will go to Cuba right now. okay. yes I'm falling blue to the critical and we're talkin about. always such a cute right. Sonia. okay. all right. are there is a quick I am in room storage room q and there is a critical victim. Q. well. this is red green I was going to say so do you see on the map is like some of the storage ones are kind of great out some of those I'm not too sure if they have people in like I want to say maybe be your ass maybe do that wasn't too sure just cuz I don't have a hammer so I didn't know if you wanted to double-check those it before we move on. this is green my hammer just broke so I do need to go back to the lobby. goodnight media.in the meantime I'll go ahead and start moving towards the left side of the building towards the the rooms and make the offices and stuff. Uncle yes I'm right here. I think we can leave now. yes.Cebu to help you out right I can probably switch to the stretcher as well and then bring everyone that we find that's not in a room that can injure us and then put them here.that sounds good.the perfect. Yeah Yeahs Yeahs. this is right if that's the case then I'm going to go to the farthest side then to take it to walk to Zurchers.the Rams okay yeah. I'm close to getting a hammer. this is red I found a critical in our business it's in the open Brake Area towards the far left side of the map I'm going to put a two in front of it just kind of like in the entire like entrance head this way we know we can do that whenever you guys are ready or willing to. the screen I'm going to check the last of the storage rooms and then head over to you guys.is blue on some Rebel and what room am I in a room 106 is going to be there. all right. he said that was a critical or. gotcha I got to make my way over towards that one just to pick it up then. I have found the fourth Chris sizes blue I found the 4th I believe I'm marking them down right now and they are in room let me double check. no 1103. when I say. okay I have one more hallway to check of this is green I'm on my holiday check and then I'll head over. Or industry. ready. is Black 2 minutes exactly or thing now I'll just running to get the medic. this is green there is one in room. storage V. just a regular. I didn't say I'm going to go pick up this is right I'm going to pick up this last victim in tea and then I'm kind of going to do like a massive just healing moment or I just feel like everybody in this kind of lobby area so we can also do criticals at that time too if that works with you guys. this is green birds also a regular bake them in room storage room TV and some gravel and I'm on my last pile of gravel. maybe you'd be more efficient if we had if we like two of us chose the medic class. okay I'll clear I'm going to start heading towards the room. I'm not too sure but I guess I would mean like double mining time I guess of Dia of the regulars.this is blue but we can try for the next game or I guess now.calendar. okay. I'll go I'll say I'll say start where you were you thinking of switching The Medic or just got a new hammer. yes this is green that works I am quizzes green I'm walking towards the lobby area. 106 for sure and 109 I think. and did you see this is why did you say that there was a critical in 103. yes. woohoo. I got let's just what I think we should prioritize the criticals there is one of those open breaker if you just want to follow me. time to do both if I'm not mistaken.I'm grabbing a new Hammer but I can. okay. and the last one is towards 103 so I guess we just make our way towards that way after this. it happened again. this is green I'm going to start heading towards the room of blue what room did you say you knew for sure there's someone in there with gravel. Niagara. Rent-A-Center. yes that is a lot of points. we might be able to have time maybe if we get there in 5 seconds. let's do it. Roblox. sorry I think I might have walked away too soon.

I believe I'm in. this is still Red by the way I believe I'm in. I just switched over to a Medics Armon and roots. I'm in one of the storage thing on the left side if there's like a red red stone block right next to the door like to. thank you there's also a bunch of of victims in here this is Red by the way. there was one of the storage units right and I had a redstone block or something. river which storage room it was blue. correct this is red it's like to the right of the door. blue on the left or the right side.

I just make sure to remember to mark any drawer or anywhere in the Tempe. You can tell if there's a prescribed over. the markets for Cameron's go back. is there anything else you just use the door saying they can't like I said it's been explored and that way there's no marking and we know that I might be gravel.. and I'm going to use these tools to mark off rooms I've emptied.Monday Night Raw. What restaurants are twos I have been using for victims and 140 victims. I was just going to add another critical in room 103. that is why do all the same interactions mean. this is blue it looks like on the interaction pain for me it says no victim is to. I'd rather fight than dressing that's what it seems like we have different one so we should probably just have a standard I guess. this is bliven marking according to my interaction pain so I guess for red we'll just say that yours your twos are victims right. all right got to choose our victims through these are critical is using threes for critical to swell. this is green I'm just moving the victim's I see into the hallway to obvious place I'm using two's four rooms that are empties and threes for criticals. this is right actually enter day.just blew I'll go back and change the medic so I can help you.how to set screen up searched the entire left side of the map from the number two rooms all the way to the left. this blue what's your location.is there a dime in the northwest.that's what I like some Jews writing for the doorway in the eyes of body was a Bolter.
