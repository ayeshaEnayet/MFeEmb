So I'll do the Helicopter lift, move you guys to the Crystal? . yeah . And the I'll wait, which one should I shore up? . Um . This one? . Which one's important? . Hmm .  Hmm . Should we do the lion next? . Proabably so shore up Whispering Garden . Ok so . yeah . I'll move one . Shore up and then I have one more move left . And . Should I do this one? . ta . I we should probably cause there's only two of these . (--) . hmm . So . So move, oh now I can;t shore up . Yeah . Never mind .  a . (--) forward next time . Hmm . Yeah . Those two . Ah . You have to draw . Oh sorry I keep forgetting . Ok . Chalice Sandbag . I can use this right? Should I use this right now? . tt . to shore up Temple? . To shore up that one? . Are we allowed to do that or you have to wait for your turn? . Um . Yeah you have to wait for your turn next . I dont' I thought this doesn't count as an action .  Yeah so should I? . But . Oh . Oh yeah that's true . It doesn't? . Yeah? Yeah? Do it? K . Yeah just to be safe I guess I would do it . And then you need three . mm two three . Um three . Copper Gate, Crimson Forest and Howling Garden . Howling Garden . Crimson Forest . And Copper Gate .  That one . Yup . Ok so I'll turn these in . K . And get this . And then . Um should I just . I can give you . This . Ah I don't know who I should give it to though . To you . Oh . Sao you, I could give it to I guess . Oh sorry I (--) give it to you . How many cards do you have though? . I only have one and she has one . Well you have five . How about the other two, that would be six . Yeah so I'd have to get rid of one . Right . So you'd have to get . Yeah that's probably not a good idea . So I'll just hold on to it . Just you . And then should I do anything else? . Mmm, what should we try to get next? . Probably the (--) . I could give you the Lion . The Lion? The lion ok . Yeah . But then we have to . Soo . So I can move here . Yeah . Oh but the other way I mean . Ok . I'd probably shore up as much as you can . Ok . Uh yeah so move (--) . So I can move . Mmhmm .  And like shore up those two . I can shore up both of these . Ok . And then I need two of those . Ok . Dunes of Deception . Silver Gate . And . The Cave of Embers, that one right there . This one . ta, ok . Ok so i'm gonna give you this card . So . And . Do you think we should shore up one? . Mmhm . Cause I can shore it up this one . (--) . Doesn't have a . Treasure so . yeah it doesnt' ahve a treasure on it so/ . Is there one that we should? . Or I can use this and shore up any of them . So which one are we gonna go . Maybe save that for later . Ok . Yeha cause . So then I'll have to . Wait did you do anything yet? . I just gave you the card . That's one action ok . yeah . Yeah so I can move more but . Yeah that's not really . Do you? . And see . What is your power? . I can give . Oh ok got you got you . You I gave you a card . So is that good or do you want me to move it on your card? . Yeah . Yeah that's it yeah .  a . Ok . And then I have to discard . Never mind . Mm .  I don't think so . Are you still aloud to give me a card? . If you didn;t do three actions? . Even though you like moved on, like after you draw one . Um I don't thin so after I . No . Ok . I don't think so . Do you . Dunes of Deception . Whispering Garden . And Iron gate . Iron Gate . Yeah . Um oh I can't move diagonally . ok so . Shoudl I move here and then turn that over? . Um . We're only at Whispering Garden though so . Oh so I should probably turn that over . Shore up it . Yeah . Yeah just shore it . So move one, shore up . And then should I do something else? . Um . So you want to move to that? . Alright ok .  So that's three . Yeah . Mmhmm . Um so I should probably discard one .  Whcih one should I discard, Chalice? . Yeah . One of . So . Mmhmm . Um Howling Garden . Crimson Forest and Temple of the Moon . And Crimson Forest . (--) . Ok . Mmk um . You should probably try to shore up . So I can shore this up . Then I can move . And then do you well or do you want to give me a card? . M oh you gusy have to be on the same island though right? . Adjacent . Oh adjacent's ok? Ok . Yeah . Yeah adjacent yeah . Think so . Do you have a card adjacent? . That's why it (--) on the back of the card . Same island as you yeah . Oh ok so this . Do you um can you still move to the same? . You can move and then move and give her one . Ok . Oh ok . Ok . And then . Would I have to discard? . Um . Hmm do you have to you only have five . This one . Ok . (-) ok . Ok . You have six . So is that . Well I haven't I don;t think this doens't . Does the Sandbag count? . Yeah I think so . Does it count? . I guess you can use it then .  Or no, I have a card . Ok so, should I get rid of it or should I get rid of . yeah so . This . Um don't get rid of the Chalice . Mmm . Ok . Mmm . Ah . Well she has three of the Earth things anyways . I'll just get . (--) . Oh yeah that's true . Ok . Oh yeah . Are you? . Are you done with . Yeah I'm done . (--) you have to move to my . Right cause you have to give me the card . Yeah oh no never mind that was an adjacent one .  Never mind . I don' have to . That doesn't matter (--) . So it's my turn now . Mmhmm . Yeah . Alright . Give that to you . But I hope to take . Oh . Two of those . And three of these . Um . Silver Gate . That's this so . Copper Gate . That's good . And . Cave of Embers . Ok . Ok . (--) doin the same . I have to discard one . Um . I'll do Helicopter Lift then . Yeah you have two of them . Oh ok . Cause I need one just to take us out of . You have one yeah . Yeah yeah . Right . Ok . And then should I shore up . Anything . Do you think? . Probably . Cool it . Cause somebody's probably gonna draw . Ok . Uh oh, I guess I'll give the Chalice away . Well we only need three things . Yeah I can give this to him . Ok so I'll give the Chalice . And then I'm on the island . So which third one do you want to get? . We have two we have this and this . Wait . Alright so I'll just take this . Wait I didn't . Cause I have four of them . (--) . Wait did you finish your turn? oh sorry (--) . No . So do you want me to shore up anything? . uum . Which one are we gonna try to get later? Chalice? . I think the Chalice and . Ok um . What are you close to? Which one are you? . Ah here . So (--) . Oh . Yeah if you want to I guess . (mm there) . To discard I guess this one . Ok . ta . So coral palacec . Mmhmm . Breakers Bridge and Cliffs of Abandon . ta . Ok so if you're gonna take the Lions . Ok I'll take the Lions . Done . You need one more . Ok so . Right . So I have three and she has one . Hmm so .

I guess if we have nothing else to.Um.Yeah if we get another water's rise card..Yeah..Ten..We could be-.This will definitely.Right, that'll make a difference..Mm..Yeah so let's do that, so fly.I guess fly, shore up.fly to.here?.Yeah..I guess then we just spread out right like?.To make sure we can shore up wherever we need to?.Yeah we're just gonna get Treasure Cards..Mmhmm..Are you , did you move over here or ok.No..Yeah..I move from here to here..You, you don't have to..So that was my first move..That's two..You still have a third..Or two..Oh ok..And third..I'd just head to Twilight Hollow so we're covering more ground..Ok..Alright..(--).Two Helicopters.You get all the Helicopters.The Helicopter collection..This?.Ok..Breakers Bridge and Lost Lagoon..Lost Lagoon..This one.(--).Alright..Oh I guess..Here you go..One..Two..And I'm just gonan give you this as my third..Ok..Cause I figured you can kind of just like..Distribute stuff out..Alright..Yeah..ahh.Alright, just gonna get the two treasures..Perfect..Alright..Sweet..Mk..Umm..Yeah flood..These two..Whispering Garden and Iron Gate..Iron Gate I saw..The top..Whispering Garden..Alright..Yeah..Um..You have a Sandbag too..Yeah..Down the road if we need that..Cause I have.We don;t need it right now do we?.I kinda think we should yeah..Well I have five, I have five cards so..It'd probably be good to get rid of one, at least I th-.Ok. Yells.Ok..Do that one..Wait..We still have three actions now..Um..Let's see..I gotta think if maybe you should.If we have.We have.Three right there..Mmhmm..And so.I kind of think you should just dump cards on to her.Ah on to the Pilot cause then next turn the Pilot can give me that..And like tha way we can just.Keep our cards kind of like sorted out..These count as cards right?.Mm yeah..Yeah..Ok..But next turn.Two, four.Ok..Um..The next one if you just fly to me and then give me this..You can give me one..Yeah alright well I'm the only one that.MMhmm..These..I don't have any of the same cards you have..So I guess..Yes and the fire to.I guess just pick a random one, or wait..Make the red one cause she's closer..Yeah but I could move around..Oh yeah she still flys anywhere..That won't..I don't know if it's worth it to give..We let's just decide one..But there's nothing else to do you know?.I don't have to, but I don't have to use..It's the only thing to shore up..Yeah you don't have to use but liek do you think its.Is it a bad thing or is it just.If he's.Cause she's gonna have to discard one anyway and he's gonna have to discard..If you've got these two though, we're gonna have to get you two more of these and two more of these whiche means that all together you'll have.(there).We definitely should get rid of at least one..Eight.Yeah..You have to give her one so you have five instead of six..And then next turn, she'll be able to fly to be and give me that so she'll.She wouldn't have too many either..In other words, I'm gonna get rid of this, so I could easily take two of those..Alright..At least one of them now..Wait..Um.Or I got it so.If you give her just like two random ones, just two of a time- two of a kind.Ok yeah, we do have to distribute them so.The when it's her turn.She flys to me.Mmhm..She gives me that..I give her this..And then she Helicopter lifts me over to the green one..Yeah..And that way she dones't have too many cards.Ok..Alright..(Horray).I'll give you this one then..Ok..Um..Water's Rise..Move that up so three..Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on..Oh yeah shuffle..I always forgot..That's the hardest part..Yeah.Or bring the.Shuffle.You have to shuffle and put 'em back..Temple of th eMoon, Iron Gate..And Breaker's Bridge..There's a Temple, that one and then.Breaker's Bridge.Ok..Ok..Got those there?.Yeah..Alright..So I'd move here..So I can shore up..This..What?.Mmhmm..Ok if you could turn that over..That's.Oh I know you have to go to the same square as me..So you can give.Is it.But don't I want to shore this up first though?.Yeah but you want to fly on top of.Me instead of.Adjacent to me cause you can only give your.On the same tile.But I could do that as two moves.Yeah..But this way you kind of like stay in the move..Oh ok..So It's like one.And then.Yeah if you just and then you still have two.Green.So.And then you can choose one of them to shore up I guess.I guess Temple of the Moon cause it has the treasure on it?.Yeah and I was gonna say we've already.You've already got one of those..Yeah..Two..That was three, flying was one..Three..Yeah.Alright..I think I got this figured out though..I know you do..Alright. I got a Sandbag..Sandbag..Two of these..Anything we need shored up? Why don;t we just.You can use that right away..Shore that up or save it..In case we need it..Um..Well you have six, I guess just shore it up..Alright..Yeah..and then three of those..whispering garden.That one..Cliffs of Abandon.And Lost Lagoon..Ok..Ah..Alright..So.wha oh.Wait..One..and.Two.yeah.That's right..I don't have time to.throw anything out.Ant then.Three.Three.Got one.And.And three of these..Mk..Copper Gate.Crimson Forest and Temple of the Sun..We lose one Crimson Forest.There's another.Copper.Gate somewhere..There it is.That was-saying I hope we didn't mess up already.Alright..Ok..Um..I can..Are you gonna.Are we so you're gonan do the lions?.What if we work on getting you.Um and then.The red one so what if you.Shore, move, sore.And then next turn, I hop on you and give you.This and you're already there.(--).Ok..Ah.And then why don't we start getting these to one person.Yeah we can s-.I'll get these yeah.Um well no I don't think we have to, yeah I don't think we have to..Oh we don't we could ignore purple actually we could just use yellow..Oh that's right..So we'll do that.Shore..If you get a red that's really good..Close, a useless one and a Water's Rise..Nope.Um..Yeah..So where' then t-.Shuffle these guys.Where's the (--) one?.Yeah a neutral one and a bad one..Mmhmm..Breaker's Bridge, Copper Gate..Crimson Forest..Coppper Gate and Crimson Forest.I always like the exact same three..Oh the bridge survived.Then Breaker's Bridge.Alright.Um I have five so I'm good.MMhmm..And.Mmhmm..Yeah..Your turn..Alright..Let's shore this guy up..Yeah..That's one..Ummm..You can fly and shore that and then next turn.(Wide).Well we have.MMhmm..This one right here..Oh that's true..How about.And we got two of these but let's just shore.I think we're ignoring purple all together..Yeah we're ignoring this I think..Ok then let's.Just do this just to be safe..Yeah I like.Just to be safe yeah I like that..Ok..Mmhmm..Alright, do you want to move me?.Soon.We have to have five, yeah five.So fly.And shore.Two three.Ok.Ok.If you get a yellow one that's good.That would be perfect..Ok and yet another Helicopter Lift..Another Helicopter.Alright you have to.Alright well you have f-you have.Ok..Dump the purples I guess.Purples.Mm both of them.Might as well keep the helicopters.yeah.Ok..Um..Yeah..Cliffs of Abandon.Lost Lagoon..Temple.And Temple of the Moon..Alright.Alright.Ah.So.Um.Do you want to.Go on to you and give you that and then shore that?.Try and give me your.I think we can (--).Mmm..Just ditch the Lost Lagoon.Doesn't really mattter..Yeah, yeah that's fine..You just need one of these, cause both of these are.Yeah.No we don't nee dpurple I thought. I thought we were.Oh yeah ok, I for-yeah.We're skipping on purple.I forgot.So yeah ah one.Two.and now you gotta get rid of your.purple or.Um.Green one.Green it's yeah.I'll get rid of this one.And then.I'll shore this up.Temple of the Sun and Whispering Garden..You need three..Three.Oh right..Whispering Garden.This first.Hmm..Two fires ok..Of course..Ah just on time.Whiserping Garden Tidal palace, so Whispering Garden.Temple.And.Tidal.Palace.Um.Hmmmfff..Shore up.Well he can't do it.Well, I'm, I'm here..Oh this still.what do you think about you ju-.I guess I can give you.no..I was gonan say what if you give me just to the two reds now?.Ok..Two reds and then you give her the gold..Ok that makes.Yeah that would probably be easier.And then I'll grab this on the next one..Alright, you have to get rid of one I think then..Alright..So, one, two.And then.three.Alot of purple.I'll give you this one..And then I'll just.Yeah..Get rid of that..Or you can use it to go there..I would have had.You might as well right?.I have six cards.Yeah so you might as well just use it.Well you can use it, you can use it right now to.Mmm..To jump over..Oh cause I can use it at any time..Mmhmm..Um..Cave of Shadows, Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate..Alright..tt..Hm..Um..Should I shore this up?.yeah..Yeah I was just.Ok..That's two.Two..Umm..Anything?.I think it makes more sense

Bronze gate.ok..So..Alright..One..And then I guess I'll just go..Two..Three..Let's keep.(Out of four).Can i get.Yeah..Helicopter and Water's Rise..Cave of Shadows, Howling Garden.Temple of the Moon

good.Two.(swimming).And then.(--).Yeah, yeah..Scared of it.Or actually wait, you can use that to Helicopter the two of us over here right?.Cause w-.Just use that to move us here..um.Alright and then i can fly myself over.Yeah..And now it's your turn, you just take the treasure.Alright.Fly with it over ther and fly out..Wait, wait..Did I.Did you do, yeah we.No I didn't do this or no i didn;t do

Yeah .  A . Ok I'm gonna do the same thing . Alright . Cause it makes . Alright . (--) to shore up . Four tiles on the first turn . Ok . Ah it was funny, I thought the game (--) . Alright . Is it . Move it up . So two . It's still two but we gotta . Yeah . Opps . Shuffle these back in . Shuffle yeah . So I expected the game and expected the tiles to be set up differently . for some reason . But . I guess not . Alright . Cliffs of Abandon, Gold Gate . Cliffs of Abandon and . Nope . Mmm . Gold Gate got removed . Gold Gate, ok . That was fast . Yeah . Alright . (--) . Alright . Alright . Let's see . Should I shore up Cliffs of Abandon? . MMhmm . Yeah I think we shore up as much as we can until we have tiles to trade with . Um yeah, I'll move to you and shore up . Mmhmm . Umm . That .  . But if you give me this now then I won't be able to get . Umm . four . either way . Yeah . Make the Water's Rise . Oh . Oh yeah . I think it's just . Well I've only used two so . Spread out so we can shore up better . Just spread out I guess? . Yeah, I'll go, I;ll go down here . Ok . Alright . The gold one and Sandbags . Two . Phantom Rock and Temple of the Moon . Oh there in different spots . I didn't even notice . Oh is that one? Ok . Oh . I'll take Phantom Rock . Alright . Yeah they . Ok ahhh . Shore that up first . We are over here still? . Mmhmm . I can fly . Um . That's true .  I guess if we have nothing else to . Um . Yeah if we get another water's rise card . Yeah . Ten . We could be- . This will definitely . Right, that'll make a difference . Mm . Yeah so let's do that, so fly . I guess fly, shore up . fly to . here? . Yeah . I guess then we just spread out right like? . To make sure we can shore up wherever we need to? . Yeah we're just gonna get Treasure Cards . Mmhmm . Are you , did you move over here or ok . No . Yeah . I move from here to here . You, you don't have to . So that was my first move . That's two . You still have a third . Or two . Oh ok . And third . I'd just head to Twilight Hollow so we're covering more ground . Ok . Alright . (--) . Two Helicopters . You get all the Helicopters . The Helicopter collection . This? . Ok . Breakers Bridge and Lost Lagoon . Lost Lagoon . This one . (--) . Alright . Oh I guess . Here you go . One . Two . And I'm just gonan give you this as my third . Ok . Cause I figured you can kind of just like . Distribute stuff out . Alright . Yeah . ahh . Alright, just gonna get the two treasures . Perfect . Alright . Sweet . Mk . Umm . Yeah flood . These two . Whispering Garden and Iron Gate . Iron Gate I saw . The top . Whispering Garden . Alright . Yeah . Um . You have a Sandbag too . Yeah . Down the road if we need that . Cause I have . We don;t need it right now do we? . I kinda think we should yeah . Well I have five, I have five cards so . It'd probably be good to get rid of one, at least I th- . Ok .  Yells . Ok . Do that one . Wait . We still have three actions now . Um . Let's see . I gotta think if maybe you should . If we have . We have . Three right there . Mmhmm . And so . I kind of think you should just dump cards on to her . Ah on to the Pilot cause then next turn the Pilot can give me that . And like tha way we can just . Keep our cards kind of like sorted out . These count as cards right? . Mm yeah . Yeah . Ok . But next turn . Two, four . Ok . Um . The next one if you just fly to me and then give me this . You can give me one . Yeah alright well I'm the only one that . MMhmm . These . I don't have any of the same cards you have . So I guess . Yes and the fire to . I guess just pick a random one, or wait . Make the red one cause she's closer . Yeah but I could move around . Oh yeah she still flys anywhere . That won't . I don't know if it's worth it to give . We let's just decide one . But there's nothing else to do you know? . I don't have to, but I don't have to use . It's the only thing to shore up . Yeah you don't have to use but liek do you think its . Is it a bad thing or is it just . If he's . Cause she's gonna have to discard one anyway and he's gonna have to discard . If you've got these two though, we're gonna have to get you two more of these and two more of these whiche means that all together you'll have . (there) . We definitely should get rid of at least one . Eight . Yeah . You have to give her one so you have five instead of six . And then next turn, she'll be able to fly to be and give me that so she'll . She wouldn't have too many either . In other words, I'm gonna get rid of this, so I could easily take two of those . Alright . At least one of them now . Wait . Um . Or I got it so . If you give her just like two random ones, just two of a time- two of a kind . Ok yeah, we do have to distribute them so . The when it's her turn . She flys to me . Mmhm . She gives me that . I give her this . And then she Helicopter lifts me over to the green one . Yeah . And that way she dones't have too many cards . Ok . Alright . (Horray) . I'll give you this one then . Ok . Um . Water's Rise . Move that up so three . Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on . Oh yeah shuffle . I always forgot . That's the hardest part . Yeah . Or bring the . Shuffle . You have to shuffle and put 'em back . Temple of th eMoon, Iron Gate . And Breaker's Bridge . There's a Temple, that one and then . Breaker's Bridge . Ok . Ok . Got those there? . Yeah . Alright . So I'd move here . So I can shore up . This . What? . Mmhmm . Ok if you could turn that over . That's . Oh I know you have to go to the same square as me . So you can give . Is it . But don't I want to shore this up first though? . Yeah but you want to fly on top of . Me instead of . Adjacent to me cause you can only give your . On the same tile . But I could do that as two moves . Yeah . But this way you kind of like stay in the move . Oh ok . So It's like one . And then . Yeah if you just and then you still have two . Green . So . And then you can choose one of them to shore up I guess . I guess Temple of the Moon cause it has the treasure on it? . Yeah and I was gonna say we've already . You've already got one of those . Yeah . Two . That was three, flying was one . Three . Yeah . Alright . I think I got this figured out though . I know you do . Alright .  I got a Sandbag . Sandbag . Two of these . Anything we need shored up? Why don;t we just . You can use that right away . Shore that up or save it . In case we need it . Um . Well you have six, I guess just shore it up . Alright . Yeah . and then three of those . whispering garden . That one . Cliffs of Abandon . And Lost Lagoon . Ok . Ah . Alright . So . wha oh . Wait . One . and . Two . yeah . That's right . I don't have time to . throw anything out . Ant then . Three . Three . Got one . And . And three of these . Mk . Copper Gate . Crimson Forest and Temple of the Sun . We lose one Crimson Forest . There's another . Copper . Gate somewhere . There it is . That was-saying I hope we didn't mess up already . Alright . Ok . Um . I can . Are you gonna . Are we so you're gonan do the lions? . What if we work on getting you . Um and then . The red one so what if you . Shore, move, sore . And then next turn, I hop on you and give you . This and you're already there . (--) . Ok . Ah . And then why don't we start getting these to one person . Yeah we can s- . I'll get these yeah . Um well no I don't think we have to, yeah I don't think we have to . Oh we don't we could ignore purple actually we could just use yellow . Oh that's right . So we'll do that . Shore . If you get a red that's really good . Close, a useless one and a Water's Rise . Nope . Um . Yeah . So where' then t- . Shuffle these guys . Where's the (--) one? . Yeah a neutral one and a bad one . Mmhmm . Breaker's Bridge, Copper Gate . Crimson Forest . Coppper Gate and Crimson Forest . I always like the exact same three . Oh the bridge survived . Then Breaker's Bridge . Alright . Um I have five so I'm good . MMhmm . And . Mmhmm . Yeah . Your turn . Alright . Let's shore this guy up . Yeah . That's one . Ummm . You can fly and shore that and then next turn . (Wide) . Well we have . MMhmm . This one right here . Oh that's true . How about . And we got two of these but let's just shore . I think we're ignoring purple all together . Yeah we're ignoring this I think . Ok then let's . Just do this just to be safe . Yeah I like . Just to be safe yeah I like that . Ok . Mmhmm . Alright, do you want to move me? . Soon . We have to have five, yeah five . So fly . And shore . Two three . Ok . Ok . If you get a yellow one that's good . That would be perfect . Ok and yet another Helicopter Lift . Another Helicopter . Alright you have to . Alright well you have f-you have . Ok . Dump the purples I guess . Purples . Mm both of them . Might as well keep the helicopters . yeah . Ok . Um . Yeah . Cliffs of Abandon . Lost Lagoon . Temple . And Temple of the Moon . Alright . Alright . Ah . So . Um . Do you want to . Go on to you and give you that and then shore that? . Try and give me your . I think we can (--) . Mmm . Just ditch the Lost Lagoon . Doesn't really mattter . Yeah, yeah that's fine . You just need one of these, cause both of these are . Yeah . No we don't nee dpurple I thought .  I thought we were . Oh yeah ok, I for-yeah . We're skipping on purple . I forgot . So yeah ah one . Two . and now you gotta get rid of your . purple or . Um . Green one . Green it's yeah . I'll get rid of this one . And then . I'll shore this up . Temple of the Sun and Whispering Garden . You need three . Three . Oh right . Whispering Garden . This first . Hmm . Two fires ok . Of course . Ah just on time . Whiserping Garden Tidal palace, so Whispering Garden . Temple . And . Tidal . Palace . Um . Hmmmfff . Shore up . Well he can't do it . Well, I'm, I'm here . Oh this still . what do you think about you ju- . I guess I can give you . no . I was gonan say what if you give me just to the two reds now? . Ok . Two reds and then you give her the gold . Ok that makes . Yeah that would probably be easier . And then I'll grab this on the next one . Alright, you have to get rid of one I think then . Alright . So, one, two . And then . three . Alot of purple . I'll give you this one . And then I'll just . Yeah . Get rid of that . Or you can use it to go there . I would have had . You might as well right? . I have six cards . Yeah so you might as well just use it . Well you can use it, you can use it right now to . Mmm . To jump over . Oh cause I can use it at any time . Mmhmm . Um . Cave of Shadows, Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate . Alright . tt . Hm . Um . Should I shore this up? . yeah . Yeah I was just . Ok . That's two . Two . Umm . Anything? . I think it makes more sense to move back then to shore up another one . It'll be his turn before yours so he can . Alright . yeah, yeah . Ok . Three . And just get rid of both of them yeah . Howling Garden . I'm on it . Cave of Embers . And Bronze gate . ok . So . Alright . One . And then I guess I'll just go . Two . Three . Let's keep . (Out of four) . Can i get . Yeah . Helicopter and Water's Rise . Cave of Shadows, Howling Garden . Temple of the Moon is . Gone . Alright . Alright, should I give you this right away? . Mmm . (--) . At the end? . We have them . Those . um . We don't need that anymore . yeah I think we should . Yeah so I'll do one . Yeah that's good . Two . (swimming) . And then . (--) . Yeah, yeah . Scared of it . Or actually wait, you can use that to Helicopter the two of us over here right? . Cause w- . Just use that to move us here . um . Alright and then i can fly myself over . Yeah . And now it's your turn, you just take the treasure . Alright . Fly with it over ther and fly out . Wait, wait . Did I . Did you do, yeah we . No I didn't do this or no i didn;t do anything . Ok where were you guys? . Alright . Cave of Embers, Breaker's Bridge and Silver Gate . Cave of Embers Silver Gate . So Cave of Embers and Silver Gate are gone . Embers and Silver Gate . Alright . I think we just won again . That . That's one . Oh . Oh we were over here thought cause you did use the Helicopter . Ok . Oh yeah, yeah you don;t have to . Alright . And then there's my free move .

Do this first . Yeah, yeah . Mmhmm . Water's Rise . Alright . Still draw two but these have two . Get . Shore . Thanks . Nope . Shuffle first . Sorry . Alright still two . Whispering Garden and Cliffs of Abandon alright . So that was fortunate . Mmm .  Ok . Mmm . Alright . Alright . I won't do this . No . Cho, cho, cho (--) . One, two . Three . Lost Lagoon and Phanthom Rock . Phanthom Rock's gone . (Is that realy on it?) . Na, dones't realy matter . (--) . Either does this one . Alright . Alright . When . I guess we'll just fl . fly here . Do this one I guess? . Well that one doesn't have anything . (--) . Yeah . Mmm . Wait, wait wait, let me see which ones do we have the most of right now? . Move two fire, two air and three purple . (--) purple . Why don't you go to the purple . Earth . Yeah one . Yeah you can go here . There's that one this one . And then . (--) just near . How about I just fly here . (--) really once . Cause . Well no go to that one cause he's closer to that one and . Does he . Three other ones here . Yeah . Around it . G'head . Yeah we . If we just make sure we protect these then that's everything we need and then we can jsut go here so we should all try to get down in this area . Ok go there . We're pretty much set yeah . Yeah . Ok so I might as well do that then cause I have an extra turn and I'm not doing anything else . Yeah I guess . Whoops . (--) again . Alright . Flood cards . Gold Gate and Breaker's Bridge . This one's before (--) . Breaker's Bridge . I guess if someone's like . Here . Drowning they can . Ok um . Somewhere . (Use it) . Alright go ahead . Where should I go? . Um . Yeah just move to f . Downward . Um . He'll go there and then do that one . Well do we need that one? . Or you just go here and do that . And undo that . (--) . (--) . And two of these . Alright . Ah . Tempel of the Moon . And Iron Gate . (--) . Alright . So . (--) . To save that . No really you just move . So . I was gonna move here cause I have two fire . And from here I can save three of those per turn . Yeah . yeah it's good . That's a good location for me so . Water's Rise . Water's Rise, oh no! . Alright . And then so notch this up that's three . Alright one (--) . Temple of the Moon , Breaker's bridge . It's gone . Does (--) . And Cliffs of Abandon . Breaker's Bridge . Cliffs of Abandon . Ok your turn . Um ta . t . t . t . t . t . t . What should I do let's see . I would say, you're this one right . Yeah . I would . Save this one . at least cause it's like a path . Yeah . And even that one is kind of a path . Well . And then . Something that might be good is . Do you need that . If you send . Why dont' I just give them to you . Don't you have them . Well . Oh wait . Shoudl I get rid of the fire one then? . Hold up, ah yeah . No actually I don't oew me, I give you one . You should have gave me that on your turn . Hold up . You have two fires so . Yeah . So . We should get all the fires to him . Next turn you . Get me the fire . I'll just save these until we see who's closest .  Let me just move . Yeah . Um so I just did one . Two . Do we really need that one? . Ah . Maybe . Let's just do it . Oh yeah we do it cause of that . And then that's your three . Yeah that's there . Yeah . Oh look, now I have three . Which one, what color are you green? . One, two, three, four . I would . Ok . I'm green yeah . I would . Yeah so if you get closer to there then you could give it to me . Alright cool . You have six cards .  I'll just use a Sandbag .  yeah . yeah . Ah I would just use a Sandbag . Oh crap . yeah get rid of the Sand bag .  We didn't (--) that much that time . Ah . Yeah you just use it and then . Just like unfllod something . Do you . Unflood . Yeah it doesn't really matter . And think . Let's do (--) . There ok . Do that one . This one cause it's closer to you still . One, two , three . Ok . ta . Whisperig Garden and we need that one . Right there . Iron Gate . That was right . And . Gold Gate . Ok . Actually . Would I would have her fly you . Okay . to ah . Here and my turn . I think soeone should stay near that to unsink it though . On my turn I can give you this and you can get that on your turn . You know what I mean . Oh yeah we could do that but someone should go toward then you shoudl move towards there and unsink it yeah do that now then . Yeah I got (--) there . Well it's her turn yeah . So . Well yeah then that will end your turn yeah . And you should, you should give me a fire . Ok so you . I can only do it if I'm on the same thingy as you though . yeah . Yeah . But . You're right here so . I mean you could move . Ah . Oh yeah you could move up . Cause if you just . Give me a . Give it to him and then fly me, that's three . Ok . Or no because in order to fly you she has to use her card so that's still only two . Yeah . Oh yeah because she (--) . I can, I can, oh I can only fly myself . You, you only . yeah .  a . yeah so you still have another action .  So you could even move back if you wanted . I mean I can I can do this on any yeah . Let's do that (--) smart . I mine as well just un . Sink . this . And then . Move here . Move him . And give you this . And give him the (--) yeah . And then find me with one of those . Alright . So then on . I'm all ready . My turn I can do it . So far you . yeah . Find me here . Ok . And then when his turn comes he'll give me a purple . yeah . I'll just get rid of that green card on there . Alright . What green card? . (--) . Oh you have, oh you only have five .  yeah get rid of the green one . yeah you only have five . (--) . Right . And on your next turn on your way here or so . Like when I give this to you . Yeah . You can give me a fire and then I can get that . Crimson Forlest Forest, Howling Garlan . eh, Howling Garden and Lost Lagoon . Crimson Forest . Howling Garden .  so both of these Gold ones . And Lost Lagoon is . Gone . Yeah we really need to save that one so can you do that now? . Yeah I'm gonna do it next time . Ok give me the cards . Alright um . Do you Crimson . So you . But I didn't flip that one . Yeah . Oh . That's one . Yeah . Then I would move he . And then you have to give me one so that's two, just give it to me now . Or no I w . Well he . He can't because you're not on the same tile, but you can move here and give me the fire . I forget that you guys can't do that . Oh yeah sure, yeah, figuered that yeah . And then we still get one yeah . And you can go next yeah .  Two . yeah . Three . Alright . That means I have six so whcih one are we not going for? We have the least of the water . I would get rid of the ah . Get . Um . We have the cup . It that . The cup . The cup yeah . yeah so discard that . Wait so how am I gonna get purple if you can't move it . Alright guys . Oh I got Water's Rise . Oh . Ok . You'll just have to move two . The purple and give it to me . Yeah . ok . Who's turn is it? . I would take . Take three . Alright . I'm gonna (--) and then . Oh yeah we know . He didn't take three up . Whispering Garden . Breaker's Bridge and Howling Garden . Hm . We got that one . It's definitely important . Yeah well . Only if we lose this, we need to make sure this is shored up . Yeah . We have these actually .  We can just use them . yeah . yeah actually . Um . I would . Why don't . Ah I wouldn't use it unless you get a Water's Rise . yeah . I think we have to play the (--) . Rise card help first .  I'm not sure, I might as well just do it now . Yeah you hae to do it right away . Oh yeah you're right yeah .  I'll just do it then .  Yeah might as well just do it . You yeah make sure . Right now? . Yeah you're right . Alright . But then my turn so I'll . Grab this . In which case send these . Are you on the same tile as him, cause you could give that to him . And then . yeah . Oh yeah cool . Give that to you and then . Ah . Yes . Well why don't you just how about you um . But . Where can you unsink anything . Look closer . Can you unsink Breaker's Bridge . Um not from where I'm at no cause I'd have to move then do it but I couldn't . No yeah . Yeah . Ok . Yeah cause I'd be out of actions .  So I could stay here or I could move up . No I would just, I would move that one yeah . Just move to that one cause whever we get if we get that stuff . Yeah just move there for now . Ok now here . Did you do the sink cards and everything? . That . Oh yeah you did . And now three . Helicopter Lift another air . Cliffs of Abandon I see . Crimson Forest that's gone . And then Gold gate . Is that really that important? . Ok . Ok now I'm going to stay there . And . Maybe I'll go to (--) . Oh good we have these now . I need to get rid of one . Oh yeah you need to get rid of one . Wait where are you . We'll meet there (--) cause I'm gonna do this . I'll get rid of the cub . If . Cause your already there . Yeah . Get it . Ok um, Silver Gate . yeah . (--) . Caves of . Embers . There .

Before you do . You can do that but you'll also give him the aiirr . Oh I . If you give him the air . Why don't you give it him and then he's gonna give me the purple one .  That's fine . yeah . Yeah I have . And he can go that way but then . That's good yeah . You could still move and give her the purple . Yeah . And then . Yeah . Yeah that's good .  W . Discard that . So then we're both set so then you can go here . And you'll be able to get that next turn/ . Yeah I can get that .  yeah I can get that yeah . Alright wait, wait, so that's one . Ok so that was one . No he doesn't need to move to me . And cause you're on the same as me . yeah . But you need to move now . So then two or then three or should I? . Er and you . No no you have to give it to me .  Because he's going to start going that way . You could move and then give it to her . Yeah . Move . That's fastest cause now on your turn you can get the purple you can get the . Yeah good idea .

How do you- . This one at (Sarah Clapp) was so much better guys .  Yeah . Ok . It was better this way .  (So wise) . Yeah . Ok, so, these are the ones we have . This is- . Can I m- . Move this 'cause it's fallin- . This card and stuff, alright . Ok . Ok . Ok . Ok, ok . Ok, so I'll start things off, um- . Shoring up- . Yeah . The two next to me . Kinda figured . Would that be- . Yeah, well- . Yeah, have- . Well, 'cause I could shore that up and then- . You have to do that, ok . I- . Move and shore the other two up . Well, clearly you're gonna get the chalice, too . 	 . Yeah . Ok, so that's- . Oh . What is that thing? Ok . All three of my actions so I'll take two cards . 'Kay . Water's rise, good . Oh good . Great . Fun . Alright . Ok, well at least- . These two did not have a- . Treasure on them . (That's) like treasure island right here . Mm . And two- Cliffs of Abandon, Phantom Rock . 'Kay . And then, yeah . Ok . (--) . So, should I give a card to anybody or just hold on to what I've got? . I'd say hold on to it, because no one really- . Um . Ok, so- . Ah eh, well, eh- (to say)- . I was going to say, depends on where you are . Well, I'm right here so I can move either here or here and shore up . (What) . Mmhmm . So, should I go down this way? . I'd move here 'cause then you'd be closer to that one . Ok . I'll go here . And shore up there and then- should I- I'll just stay there . That good? . Yeah . Yeah . Ok . Mmhmm . Alright . So- . I got another one of those, which is good . Ok . Mmhmm . So I'll give you this thing on my turn . Ok . That's good . Two . Lost Lagoon and Gold Gate, so that's gone . Ok . So- . Don't really see anything- . You could shore up Lost Lagoon if you wanted . Up to you, I guess . Ok . Uh . Ok . Yeah, why not? . Yeah, that's fine . 'Cause- well- how 'bout just stay here, because he could just do that- . And then- . You know what I'm saying? . And there's- we won't really lose anything if it does go . I'll just stay over here . Other than like you said last game, keeping that card in the pile . Yeah . Other than- . Er, right . So, um- . Like, other cards'll be drawn . How 'bout I just draw treasures? . Mm . Alright . I mean- . But is there, like- what is the point of not doing it? . Ok . Yeah . Ok, fine . Ok . Ok . Thank you . Mmhmm . Ok, Breaker's Bridge and Temple of the Moon- . Alright . Alright . So- . Here . What do I want to do? . I (wanna) give this to you- . 'Kay . And then I'll probably shore up Temple of the Moon, at least . Mmhmm . Mmhmm . I think- . Just move in here somewhere . Well- . I'm gonna do one- Oh, oh ok, I can't move after that- two . Yeah . And then three . Ok . Thank you . Mmhmm . Ok . Ok . 'Kay . So, um . Let's see, do (I)- . Does anybody have fire?	 . Worth giving them the fire card . Um . Nnmm . Yeah, I don't know, man . Ok . We don't really have that much anyway . If anything- . Yeah . We do- . If anything, I'd give it to you- . On my turn . Yeah . Mmhmm . 'Cause he's- er- or, 'cause I need- I'll- . Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah . Uh . Probably get this . Right . Mmhmm . So, in that case, I'm just move closer to the- . The chalice . The chalice . I think that's a good idea . Yeah . So, I'll move one, two- . And then shore this up . Cool . And (that)- . Done? . Yep . Ok . Right . Alright . (Let's) not (lose) Whispering Garden- . Please . Oh yeah . One- . Two- . Three- ok, Temple of the Moon, Cliffs of Abandon, Breaker's Bridge . Oh, do we not have another one out? . Ok . Ok . Wait- . There's (red one) there . What did we lose? Oh, Cliffs of Abandon . Oh, the cliffs . Yep . Er, not lose but- . Ok . Oh, we didn't lose anything, great . (It's just you) . Alright . Ok . Ok, so- . And then I have a, rock which I have to get to you . Right, and I need to give this to you .  So I'm gonna move- . (--) . Onto here- . Eventually and then give this to you . Mmhmm . Hopefully- . Can give that to you, you'll be ready on your turn, when your turn comes around- . And then you can trade (to me)- . For your move . Mmhmm . Ok . Ok . So, I'm basically just gonna shore up stuff, right? . I- . Looks- yeah, looks that way . So, should I move here and then shore up these two? . I think that's a good idea . Mmhmm . 'Kay . Good . Yeah . Yeah . Um . Do you want me to use this to get that back? . Oh, the garden? . Yeah . Uh . 'Cause we don't- it's not here . (Ok) . Yeah, what do you guys think? . Um . Oh, it's weird because you moved away from it . That's so rare . To use sandbags, (you know mean), it's the card to actually to use- . Yeah . I know . I mean, I was gonna think, since these three are clustered so close together and that one's over here, we can sorta ignore this top half, yeah? . Ok . Right . Just ignore it? . Ok . Ok, so then, did you use all three of your actions? . Ok . Mm . Yeah . Alright . Mm ok . Well- . Alright . I mean it's fine, discard fire . I sho- . Ah . What? . I know I shouldn't because I'm so close to it . Oh . Oh . Oh- (--) . Sandbags can be used at anytime, though, so- . Yeah, ye- ye- ye- yeah . You have seven, you have to ditch two . I know, so I'm na have to ditch- . Ok . These two . So- . If this can be used on- . Any- at anytime, can I use it right now? . Yeah . It's anytime, right? . Oh yeah . Mm . Ok, then I'd like to flip that . (That's) a good idea . Ok . Ok . Alright, then I have to draw three . We'll see if that was a good decision . Hopefully it was . It was . Good . Uh- . Temple of the Sun- . This one- . And Iron Gate- . Yeah . My hair was, like, really slippery right now, ok- . Um . So . Yeah, I need to get that, one of the earth cards you have . And you are- . Ok . Blue . Wait, are we doing this first, though? . You have to be on the same tile as him . Yeah . Yeah . Oh, right . Sorry . I mean, she- she could move- . Blue . And you can give, um- . Mm . As many cards as you want, right? . I th- . Like, per- per action? Ok . I got you, I got you .  You're saying, like, you wanna- . Have- b- get both of those cards so then I can get- . To earth? . And then that way we can save on actions? . Well, 'cause I'd still have to wait for my turn to get- . The earth from you .  What's (at)- is that what you're thinking? . Yeah . Ok, so you can- . One action is as many cards, right? . No, just one card . Or just one action per one card? Alright, right- . Yeah, one action per card . Yeah . Ok . So, do we wanna the chalice first or the earth? . Or the stone thing fir- . Uh . Um . I mean, I can't do both . We cannot get the chalice right now . Oh, I thought we were gonna give the stone to him, 'cause he has two . Yeah . Yeah . Ri- ri- right . Yeah . So- . Um . And we can do the chalice right now . We should focus on the chalice . Yeah . Mm 'kay . Ok, yeah .  So you should move to me . Because- . Yeah . Ok . Give me the chalice, and then, I guess shore up- . The bridge? . Ok, yeah that sounds good . Will there be anything else to do- because she can fly somewhere else, also . Um, can you just scoot that over? . No, I think that's a good idea . Ok . 'Kay . Alright . Ok . So, we've got Coppers Gate- . And the Crimson Forest and Lost Lagoon . Right (here) . Ok . No problem . Ok . Ok, so I'm just gonna- . Move to you . Wait, where were you? . So, it's gonna take- . You should shore up firt . You think so? . He can't- . It's gonna take three actions . For me to move to you and give you the chalice . Mmhmm . Oh . Ok . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Unless we wanna lift you there- . 'Cause she has two helicopter lift cards .  I don't know if you'd wanna do that . I do . Oh . Do we wanna do that? . 'Cause you (want)- . You're going here for the- . The wind, right? . There's only- . Are you going here or here? . I- I- . I could get there in one turn . However- . Ok . I see .  Or, we could (--) helicopter lift you there . If- . To the- like over here, you mean . That's true .  I was gonna say the only way that won't work is if someone gets water rise- . Yeah . And those get- . Oh . Back in- in it- . Oh . I see . Gets lost but- . Mmhmm . Let's not worry about that . If- . So you can do whatever you're- . Ok . I think I should- . Whatev- . Walk over and give you the chalice and we can save the (lift)- . Ok . Yeah, that's fine . For her and that way we're still close to (during) the- . Fool's Landing . Yeah, that's fine . Ok . Ok . Mm . Ok, and then, I should ditch fire? . Yeah, I think so . Ok . Yeah . Thanks . So that's one, two, three . So you're done? . Ok, so we're going over- after stone, chalice and- . Yeah, I'm done . Thanks . (Water)- wind . Water's rise . Cool . That was expected . Will you move that tick up? . Yeah . The tick- . Oh . Can you move that up- thank you . Oh, right . Alright . Copper Gate, Cliffs of Abandon, and Whispering Garden . Copper Gate's gone- . This is gone, this is gone- . Where are (they)? . What's the other one? . Cliffs of Abandon, this one . Ok . 'Kay . Ok, so, before I- . Do anything on this turn, we're on the same space- . I'm going to give this to you for one of my actions . Go- go- good . Second one- . Move here . Third one- . Then third- . Awesome . Get the chalice . Cool . Alright . Right . Got a lift and a stone . Great . I don't want two, though . I know, I know, it's like I don't want two . Ok, Temple of the Sun, Breaker's Bridge, Crimson Forest- . That's, yeah, that's gone . Ok . Oh and Crimson Forest is gone, too . Huh . That was the Temple of the Sun, right? . Yeah . Ok . So we cannot lose Howling Garden or Temple of the Moon . Breaker's Bridge is gone, too . Oh . Man . That was a lot . But that's fine, 'cause we should be done in a least a couple more minutes, I think . Yeah . Yeah . Um . Ok, well- . The only the way to get me here is to airlift me . Ok . Mm . Ok . So- . Um . Would it be- . Are we having you go after any- . I have two of them . What? . I'm just trying to think, do we- 'cause I can take on more cards . So- . That's a good idea . Should you use one to free up more space? Ok . I agree with it . Yeah, definitely . Alright, so that doesn't count as a turn and I'm here . So, here's one- . Action- . Cool . We have this . And then- . Um . I guess you could- . I should just move- . Towards here- . Right? . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . That's a good idea . So should I just go- . I think you wanna go here, just in case we need anything shored up . 'Kay . One, two- . Yeah . Or if we need to give each other anything . Ok, done? . That's true, yeah . Yeah . Mmhmm . Yeah . Fires . Ok . 'Kay . This one- . That one- . And this is gone . Ok, um- . So we're going after this one, we'll probably get that pretty soon- but I could just give this to her . Well, you should- no, you should give this- . Or- . To him . Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah .  That way we'll have the three . To him .  Oh, well, yeah, sorry . Yeah . So that's turn one . Ok . Ok . Then- . Um . Mm . Maybe- . And then- . I think- . Personally, that you should go up here- . And just shore this stuff up, yeah . And shore that up . Ok . Sounds good . (Uh) do you guys agree or- . Ok, that's fine, too . (Yeah) . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . That makes sense . Ok . Um . Because then you can move diagonally . Well, I'll do the first- . Right . Oh . 'Kay . What? . I don't know, you wanna shore up- . No, no 'cause you need- that's one, you did one, and we need to shore this one up . No no, you need to- you need to- . Move here, and then shore that up . Yeah, yeah, yeah, because that's the last place we can get earth from . Oh ok . Here . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Ok . Ok . Ok . And then, so I just use two, right? . Three, 'cause one was giving him the card . THree . You used three 'cause one was- . I gave him one and then I shored- ok . Yeah, so you're good? . Got it . Yeah . Ok, Cave of Shadows- . And then Dunes of Deception- . And Silver Gate . Ok . Alright . So, you can move diagonally .  That's cool . Yep . Yeah . Hmm . One- . Check us out . Yeah, so now we just need to worry about- . Two for earth- . (--) . Before you do that, though, should you shore up Cave of the Shadows while you were there, initally? . Moving to- . Thank you . That's what I was thinking . Yeah . Oh, you can do that diagonally .  Nevermind . I can, yeah . Ok . We're gonna do that- . And then should you move back? . No, 'cause it's three moves .  I moved- . Oh, that was three? . Yeah, yeah, yeah . Yeah . Oh, ok ok . Yeah . Cool . Ok . Yeah, so I'm gonna grab treasure and- . Thank you . Ok . 'Kay so now we just have to get back . So, we're good .  We can leave now, yeah . And we have the helicopter card, as well . (Ok) . Alright . So, who's farthest away? . Alright . Howling Gardens- I am but I should be- . I mean, we're pretty close I think . Cave of Embers . Mmhmm . Yeah, and Bronze Gate . Yeah, we're good . Ok . Oh, we have two helicopter cards, too . Yeah . Yeah, we do . We needa save of them, though . Ok, so now it's my turn . Mmhmm . So- . All I need to do is move here . Mmhmm . Ok . I'll take two- . Of these . I knew that was comin' . Yep . Knew it . Ah but nobody's in a place where they're gonna drown and- . Yeah, that's true . Yeah . We have three lifts so if anybody needs to be- . Actually- . Hmm . Yeah, if we wanted, we could just- . Airlift everyone right now- well no, no, no, no- . No, no .  We'd still need one . Yeah, then you need one . We can't, we still have one, yeah . Yeah . Yeah . You can air- we can airlift after my turn . So, we could- . We- . I mean, you don't really need to airlift me . 'Cause you're next, why don't we airlift those two- . So I can move- . Then you move and she does the last one . Ok . But first- . Ok . Howling Gardens- . Tidal Palace . Tidal Palace . Silver Gate . Is that all three? . Yep . Oh yeah . Ok . Then I'll use these two helicopter lifts to put you guys on here- . Ok . Fantastic . ('Kay) . Now let's get into here . So it's my turn . Yep . I move- . Alright . Ok, and then it's my turn and then we're out of here, so- . And you use your helicopter . Yeah . Yay . Go um- . Boom, done . Dude, wow, yeah . Significantly much better . Yeah, we, nineteen minutes left . Alright .

I'm gonna fly over there anyway or I can fly up there. Don't worry about that one..So what do you think? Just go up?.Just go up yeah..You mine as, yeah just move on ok..Ok..So treasures.No you gotta Helicopter.And then three of these..Mmhmm..Three oh God..Howling Gardens, Whispering Garden..Howling Garden..Cliffs of Abandon.Well.This guys gone..So I'll take Howling Garden..And CLiffs of Abandon and Howling Garden..Oh ok..Well at least you can fly up to Whispering Garden and get the Statue thing..Ah (--) goes here..We just need two more of these..Now it's your turn..My turn, ok I'm gonna move.Oh,.Right.Not the Water's Rise Cards, oh that's right my bad..Ok so this moved up..Did you move that? I don't think we did..I don't think I moved it..Yeah so move it up..So move it up..Ah..Oh..Oh ok..Oh ok. Ok..Oh yeah.Cool..to do is.This should be his purple.Oh yeah.There's one and there's really not much else I can do.That's me.Let me move this up and.Wait why don't.Wait hold on stay there, he can fly you there and then he can fix Whispering Gardens..I'll fly you somewhere.Ok that works. Does that count as an action?.Yeah..Nope, the flight doesn't.No if I fly you ti doens't..Ok..So.So you're here now..yeah..So now I can flip Breaker's Bridge and.Just Whispering..Er.Whispering Garden.Yeah but I still have two actions left..Do you?.Didn't you.Yeah I just trade one.You traded one..So I still get two more..Oh ok..Ok..Wait I oh and I trade cards I can give to anybody that's my special ability so technically I still have three.Yeah..Oh right..Right..It doens't.Don't I?.Well you can trade anywhere. It still costs an action though..Trade.Yeah..Right so you still have two..Yeah it's not a special ability if it still costs an action.Ok so you might as well just flip both of them over. That Breaker's Bridge and we're safe..So.Flip..Ok cool..Ok..Alright so um.Treasure Cards and these guys..Your.Treasures.Oh yeah and then.Oh yeah there we go, this is in the back (--) so there's that..Alright.Yeahthis is not good. Cave of Embers..That's right. we don't care about that anymore..Ok..So there's that..Temple of the moon.Every time..Yeah that's not a good thin either unless there's another one.Wait.Oh is that one already gone?.up.Cave of Embers.Oh it's here..Oh.Hm..Now it's gone..Ah that's ok who cares, alright..Cool and then these one's go.

Ok . Alright . Ok so let me sh . Same start as last time? . Yup . Right so let me shore this guy up . And ah shore this one up . Or should I move and then shore? . Na you're right .  Yeah do that . Well you can shore them up . You can shore them both up . Right so one turn . And a move I'll shore them both up . Yeah, good . One turn . you got it . And then um, yeah . Two game cards, I'll hold on to this . Ok thanks, Water's Rise . So move that up . Mmhmm .  And you still have two . Right . ah wait, hold up we gotta shuffle those back in . We have to . Shuffle them and put them on thanks . Oh that's right, you have a Water's Rise, my bad . Yeah . Just choose two . Now . Breaker's Bridge, Whispering Garden . Whispering Garden, Breaker's Bridge so Whispering . Breaker's Bridge is next to it . Ok . Watch this be the same game . Ha . Yup .  Alright so I'm going . Cause you only have one .  One of these and I'm gonna give you this . (--) one action . You have to be on the same tile . No not if he's the Messenger . Aye . He's in . Oh I'm sorry . I'm the Messenger yeah . Your call . Um that's one thing I'd like to do .  I'm looking at . Um I'm gonna . If you . Shore it . Wait should I move or do you think I should shore this up first? . Yeah that's a good idea, I'd shore that up . Cause that's one of the important tiles that we need so . And the same with these symbols should we shore it up first that's . Ah and then I'm . Going to make this mine as well just move . I can move down and then you two can switch cards later . Yeah . Right . I take it you have a green one (--) . Yeah there we go alright so there's that so now I need two of these . Sweet Sandbags and (--) . And then two, one two . Two of them . Cliffs of Abandon and Gold Gate . Where on Earth is (--) ok so Gold Gate . Gold Gate's gone . Cliffs of Abandon are here .  We get that one every turn .  We still don't know where it is . Not now . Alright your turn . Ok so for mine . You can fly anywhere . Ok . I think I'm just gonna move here and then shore these two up though . Yeah . Is it? . That's one action right? Yeah . We not that would be . No it's . That'd be two . And you flew so three . Yeah . Two helicopter Lifts so you have (--) . Helicopter . Lost Lagoon . And Rock . Lost Lagoon and Phanthom is gone . It's right here .  Phantom is by you . Ok same as last time . That's ok . Alright Explorer your turn . An should I just go to a purple one then? or . Move diagonally if you can, I mean . Soon . I don't know how much all that's gonna be . um . Um . Um . Shh . So you . Yeah . Hmm ok . Your . I mean if you were feeling really fancy you could go shore that one up . You could possibly actually trade him give him one of your yellow dragon cards or whatever that thingy is and then give him one that way he has five and then next turn he can Helicopter Lift one of us over in case that needs to be done so . Oh yeah . Good call . Or what about, so she's got two of these if she Helicoptered to you . Helicopter to me . Well it's easy for him to give them away . Oh yeah it's easier for you to get rid . Yeah it's easier for me to give them away you could that way it doesn't sum up how many cards . That's right . Yeah so I'll start, I'll start collecting these ones then . Right . Yeah cause he can use these during his actions and then they can go, so why don't you give him that .  that's one action . Cool . So just go down there and then cause you have to be on the same tile . Yeah . Ok so one two . So one two perfect and then three . And then action . (really) . Great . That's really the only actions we can do so . Two of those . Then two of those (--) . Yeah cool . Cool . Here ya go . So Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon . Ok . Cool . Thanks . Alright . Mmhmm . Alright so . I'm gonna throw this in and save the Temple of the Moon cause that's one of the important ones just in case . Mm .  ok . Alright . That's ok . Um, Iron Gate we don't care about, we don't care about that . So . You could give him a green . Yeah you can give me your grene card .  I can collect these chalices (--) . Right . Right and then um . Move that one and shore up Lost Lagoon if you're bored . yeah mine as well do that . So move down, shore it up . Ok . You need two of these . Two of them, Water's Rise . So this moves up one . One of these . Shuffle them . One two three . Thanks . Yeah Breaker's Bridge . Ha, ooh of course . Iron gate . It's this one . Iron Gate is over there so that's sunk . That's gone .  This is what happened last time .  (--) . Ow yeah . Right . Ah Lost Lagoon is good . Honestly (--) matter . Alright so it's my turn? . Ok mmhmm . Alright I'm gonna give you . Cause I have this special this counts as one action right? . Yeah . Hm . I'm gonna give you that . Yeah . And then . You're on the same space . Ah either way . Well he's the Messenger . Mm I . You . Oh I'm sorry I keep forgetting that rule man . I'm the Messenger . I know it's cool um . You might as well shore up that bridge . I'm . Yeah I mine as well just do those .  I mean there's really nothing else I can do . Not this point . Wait I think you can only do one .  Cause that was your action . You can trade and you can move and you can shore . Or you can . Oh you cna move or . Just shore this guy up and . And . Ah I don't know it doesn't matter . You can only save one . BUt you should . Well Lost Lagoon makes no difference to me as things are gonna, it's like they're gonan be moving in so . Yeah . And that's three .  Cool there we go guys .  c . Mmhmm, Treasure . yeah Sandbag look at that . Mine as well just save Lost Lagoon while I'm at it or I'm acutally gonna hold on to it yeah that was a good point and I have a purple, oh ok cool . Or do you want to save it . Yeah hold on to it for now . Yeah . Yeah . Temple of the Moon . Whispering Garden . And cities of or CLiffs of Abandon . So . It's a good think you saved them Sandbags . Ah do you guys want me to save one or . Um . If you save that one I'll fix those two . Wait . Ok so can you flip Temple of the Moon over .  I'm gonna throw that in here and these go over here . Cause nothing's changed then I . We could all . Great . Guess we could see . Ok . Then we're good right . It's your turn now yeah . Mhmm . So his collected what you're in the Fire . You should probably fly people over cause you can't have when you ahve to draw cards, you can't have you can only have . That's true um . You have to discard so I mean . You can also fly yourself . You could can you give one of you cards to somebody? . No you can't transfer these ones . You can't do that . Well no you can use . we can . I mean I could fly you two somewhere but I don't know where I'd even fly you . What I'm thinking is here fly . Well if you fly me here then we can do a bunch . Yeah . Ah no we can only trade . Actually why don't I come . If I come here . Right . Give you that . That's two . Ok . And then fix that . Perfect . And then . You're gonna have to discard one so, you could discard the purple one . What do I not want . Yeah because you're gonna get that . Ok and then three . Ok . Alright . Copper Gate . Crimson Forest and Howling Gardens . Ok yeah . Cool . At least we still have one in play so . Mmhm . Mm . Your turn Explorer . Mm do you want . Do either of you . Mm shot excuse me . I'll take that yellow one . Ok so . Trade him the yellow and . One two and do you want the red one? . So you moved the once, and then this was the second one and then yeah I'll take that . Thank you . That's three . And that's three .  So here's your two cards .  You're gonna have to discard . That's three . And then . He's gonna have to discard .  Oh no he doesn't have to discard yet . Na this is just my . So there's that, so yo umine as well just discard that one . Discard the fire . Discard the fire . And then you're gonna have to give me both of them .  Give me both of them back . Oh no, he can she can keep the fire . Imean that's my fifth one so . Yeah she's good . Oh yeah that's right .  You have a fifth card but that one's gonna go up . So Water's Rise so you move that up . So (--) three . Ok and then . So yeah shuffle . So three (--) . Ihope it's not one of the bad ones . So Breaker's Bridge, Lost Lagoon and Copper Gate . Copper Gate's gone ah . Lost Lagoon is it . That's done . Copper Gate . Copper gate, Lost Lagoon and Breaker's Bridge . Alright . Oh . Breaker's Bridge is gone . Ok  . No oh sorry .  That was just no . Yeah I just flipped it yeah . Ok you just did it? Ok cool .  I was gonna say, I'd be swimming . My idea for you, you should move down here and trade these four in, you go . Right . Or do you want to . I could just fly us all right there cause that's actually closer to where we need to be . Yeah we can all fly . Ok then that works too . Cool alright . I like the actions . That doesn't count for one of the actions does it? . No . No that was a Helicopter .  So trade these in this is one action . Trade these in, you can take the fire . thing . nice . Yeah look at that one of then down . Actually does he still have an action left? . He still has two . I have . So I'll take that . Two actions . I'll take the lion . Ok . There's two and then you mine as well flip Breaker's Bridge while you're at it . I can't it's diagonal . You can't diagonal . That's diagonal aw . Just move close to fool's I guess . You mine as well just move over to Watchtower there . Actually just move up there and then you can fix those two on your next turn if they're still there . Yeah that's a good point . Is it still there? . Or do we want to save . Wait wait, why don't you move over here cause they I can move and up and fix those two . Oh I can fix two at a time . But you you have to go there . And I can fly over there .  I'm gonna fly over there anyway or I can fly up there .  Don't worry about that one . So what do you think? Just go up? . Just go up yeah . You mine as, yeah just move on ok . Ok . So treasures . No you gotta Helicopter . And then three of these . Mmhmm . Three oh God . Howling Gardens, Whispering Garden . Howling Garden . Cliffs of Abandon . Well . This guys gone . So I'll take Howling Garden . And CLiffs of Abandon and Howling Garden . Oh ok . Well at least you can fly up to Whispering Garden and get the Statue thing . Ah (--) goes here . We just need two more of these . Now it's your turn . My turn, ok I'm gonna move . Oh, . Right . Not the Water's Rise Cards, oh that's right my bad . Ok so this moved up . Did you move that? I don't think we did . I don't think I moved it . Yeah so move it up . So move it up . Ah . Oh . Oh ok . Oh ok .  Ok . Oh yeah . Cool . to do is . This should be his purple . Oh yeah . There's one and there's really not much else I can do . That's me . Let me move this up and . Wait why don't . Wait hold on stay there, he can fly you there and then he can fix Whispering Gardens . I'll fly you somewhere . Ok that works .  Does that count as an action? . Yeah . Nope, the flight doesn't . No if I fly you ti doens't . Ok . So . So you're here now . yeah . So now I can flip Breaker's Bridge and . Just Whispering . Er . Whispering Garden . Yeah but I still have two actions left . Do you? . Didn't you . Yeah I just trade one . You traded one . So I still get two more . Oh ok . Ok . Wait I oh and I trade cards I can give to anybody that's my special ability so technically I still have three . Yeah . Oh right . Right . It doens't . Don't I? . Well you can trade anywhere .  It still costs an action though . Trade . Yeah . Right so you still have two . Yeah it's not a special ability if it still costs an action . Ok so you might as well just flip both of them over .  That Breaker's Bridge and we're safe . So . Flip . Ok cool . Ok . Alright so um . Treasure Cards and these guys . Your . Treasures . Oh yeah and then . Oh yeah there we go, this is in the back (--) so there's that . Alright . Yeahthis is not good .  Cave of Embers . That's right .  we don't care about that anymore . Ok . So there's that . Temple of the moon . Every time . Yeah that's not a good thin either unless there's another one . Wait . Oh is that one already gone? . up . Cave of Embers . Oh it's here . Oh . Hm . Now it's gone . Ah that's ok who cares, alright . Cool and then these one's go .  I have these two on top of here and then it's your turn . Oh yeah . Ok so . So should fly . I've gotta fly over here for one action . Take those two . And then ah . Cash them in . Two actions . And then . And then let's go . We'll walk back down here for my third . Yeah there you go . And then I need . Treasure cards and these . Oh yeah, two treasure cards .  We still have twenty three minutes, we're good . Three . It's . And then three . Alright so Coral Palace . Dunes of Deception's one of them . Dunes of Deception and (--) . K . Where's Coral Palace? . And right here? . Oh . Yeah, that's that's not good . Oh wait we still have Tidal Palace . Ok should I get the purple one first? Ok so . Oh yeah . Or do you want to fix that first? . Actually yeah good call . Fix Coral Palace yeah, you mine as well fix Coral Palace since you have three . One . And then move and then cash in . Yeah you can cash in . So that's three moves . Wait yeah . Third action's ok . One to three and then the little purple thing is yours alright . That was how we all have to get to the . Yeah we don't even need the green one anymore . Yep . Fool's Landing .  Oh yeah . Ok s we need treasure cards and these . We gotta flood yet . There's your two cards which is fine and one two . Couldn't we just fly with the Helicopter Card now? . But then we need it to fly out . Oh right right .  Good call . Thanks so Temple . Who's the red? . That's me . Ok so then you can just move over next turn . Tidal Palace and (--) . Or . Oh right we need the Helicopter card .  Gottcha . Ok so who's turn is it? You mine as well move to Fool's Landing . Move and finish . There's that . Ok so I need these cards . And then finish your turn . Water's Rise so . Oh that's great .  It's ok we're still on three . And (--) that .

Ah Temple of the Moon . So Silver Gate's gone . K . Temple of the Moon, isn't that gone? . no . Oh (--) . Oh sorry that was Sun and I took Moon . It was up top . Oh . So that should have been flipped . Temple of the Sun should be flipped .  Ok there you go . Yeah . But now (--) it would be gone cause it would've been flooded . It's gone anyway so . Ok . So something's gotta go back in . Dunes of Deception . Is that already flipped or did someone just flip that? . (--) . That was already flipped . So I think it's out . Yeah that's . K so it's gone . Yeah it's flipped so . That's ok . Alright . It's my turn, I'm just honestly at this point going to move over . Hold up, up up, I'm forgetting to put this away . up, there we go . Hmmf .

So I wanted to use that..Yeah.So you might as well just.Get on the Temple.Ah.You're green.I don't know why I can, you're even wearing green.Hmm.So I did one.And this is.two.My second.Hmm.Hmm.Ok cool.And then I can end.yeah.can i have two moe?.Thank you.Ok.Temple of the Moon.And Iron gate.Hmm.Should I use my Sandbag to do Temple of the Moon right now?.Yeah I would say so.Mmm..Mm no I would save it.cause it's in the.Yeah ok actually you're right..I'm pretty likely to get a Water's Rise I think so.yeah you're right,you're right.Ok.right.oh yeah put that there and save it ok.when do you guys think I should save these?.ta.What you have the crystals?.Like I wouldnt care about this, but this would be pretty important.yeah I would save this one..save that one.maybe save that one and work towards cave of shadows.yeah.yeah um.no, might as well save both if I can.Two.three.yeah good idea.wait cna you save.Ok.I'm the engineer.He his power is that he can save two.Oh, ok.Look at that Water's Rise.Oh good call.oh.Always get water's rise.Hmm.Oh move that up, so now we're at three already.So now we're at three ok.Temple of the moon.Oh.Oh.Lost Lagoon and Iron Gate.Alright so Iron Gate's gone.That's not that important right?.yeah it doesn't matter.ok.Um so now.You should give me that.You should give, do you want to get rid of your red?.No cause I need the red, oh but you're so far away shoot.So maybe keep this?.Well.Mmm, well closer a little bit here.ta.I say get rid of her red.Get rid of her red cause you have a red.Are you, you're kind of close to the gold to so I'd stick with.I'd get rid of the red.Yeah actually that's probably a good idea..We and we hav emore gold than the purple. Cause I have a gold and you have a gold..Yeah.We currently have four reds though out..ta.Yeah but she's not.oh yeah.We have four golds, we have three purples..Is purple really im.Mmm it's kind of important.Well.Cause she's on (--).It's just because I already have two.No.right.and she's on it. I mean you could easily draw..Any of us could draw another purple..Any time and then be able to give it to her..(--).true.Yeah.I can't really do anything else at this point so I don't know.yeah I.would cause I'm already here to, so all I would have to do is.yeah that's true.flip it if I got another one.unless i want to move.no ok..I was gonna more closer to where.I have.Something but.mhmm.ta.I can do that as well..well if she goes.wait.I just can't save lost lagoon but that doesn't really matter at this point.It doesn't matter if we lose that.Mm..Don't want risk the red.One, two.ok so what treasures are we going after.the.the purple?.oh I wish that you could.diagonally do something because then if you had just moved one two oh no that wouldn't work anyways.Yeah.Also I'm red.Oh that's right.oh yeah I'm gray.oh that's right.oh.then you should save this.Oh yeah, I would move one over and then save this, and then give me that..save this.sounds good..we can do that..Ok so one over and then you save this and that's two and that's three.save that yeah and then that'll be.And then which one should I get rid of?.oh.Um.probably ll.I would get rid of red, oh.well it kinda doesn't matter there's even odds either way I think.yeah I was gonna say.I want to say red, just because I already have two.so if by chance I don't know.that's just.Either way you're gonn have to get rid of another one. When another one comes along..In my heart.Yeah I think (--) is good..Ok and then I'll take these two. Oh I got another Sandbag..another purple.oh good.I'm taking three of these.Ah Whispering Garden.ta.Where is oh thank. Cliffs of Abandon.right next to it.and Breaker's Bridge.ok oh ok.oh my gosh they're all on a row.ta.we'll ahve to watch out for that. Should I use another Sandbag for whispering garden?.mmm.No save it for now..She's already on this one so.Ok.alright.true.Soooommm.Should I.(--) so I can fly to places.you can fly anywhere.should i fly over to you?.you can only do it once a turn though..is the thing.ok right, yeah, but we don't have that many like li.that that's the trick cause I was thinking the same thing.I guess she's not gonn abe able to give.why.like she's not gonna be in the position to give me a card. So what I was thinking is.Mm.unless you move yourself. You could.Oh yeah and you can go anywhere on the board.You know I would move, because if you move then she can give a lion away and she'll have room for one more purple.yeah that's a good idea actually.cause otherwise we're gonna lose a Lion when she gets another card cause she's at max.oh ok.so.I'll fly over to you and then.and that counts as an action, you flying.Mmhmm..you fly over to m.to me.and then on your turn you would.I can give you both of these.give me both and then you (--) so I'll do that.Ah cause I could always fly back to.good.I mean I could fly at any time back to the Hollowing.One.garden.or the whispering garden.unless.if that's not, is that permanent?.no she said it doesn't be to be..Ok so if we if you flew over here you could s or.Oh now you cant move dianonally, never mind. I was gonna try to save this one but.if it's not as important.Oh.or save this one cause then you're already closer.but then you wouldn't have enough moves.well i could fly to here save that one and then move to her.yeah that's what I was thinking but is Cliffs of Abandon important?.This one's more important.Yeah but she can't move diagonally I don't think. So that's.Mmm.yeah.I mean it could be mmm.No cause it either.Nnmm.To get to Flood's Fool's landing would be the same difference.same number of moves.Do we save it just.Do we save it just because?.we can.mine as well. I don;t think I'm going to do anything else with the move.So you flew over to there yeah. Saved there.But if I fly here.MM..Oh yeah we'll say you flew there so that's one..That's two.Saved and then I'll move to you.And then back is three..And then he moved..Ok..oK..Mmm..and now.Ew, I may have to discard a card to..Just fine..I can get rid of this one or the (--).well.Well get rid of the chalice because.yeah c.If you give her the.Um.purple thing.She can get the treasure.Mmhmm..Well she has the purple to like we.I'll have.yeah get rid of the chalice.MMk..Mmm.That's reasonable..Ok and then those guys..ta.Copper gate.Tss.Howling garden.And Crimson forest.Crimson Forest.This one right up here..Oh yeah.This one.Ok so.Well maybe move diagonally and save Copper Gate and Crimson Forest.That's what I was thinking to.Yeah I would go.But then you would be on it.No but I can go back.Yeah.Cause I can move diagonally.Oh true.So.One.One save this.Mmhmm..Go bck.That's what I would do.Yep..Right?.Ok.And can I have that?.two of these.Ahhh.Dang it..Ok so that has to be played and I'll just discard that..Yeah I'll shuffle 'em.Ok..cause we have one, two, three open.I guess I can take that one too..oh yeah thank you..Mmhmm..We keeping track of how many?.I think.So two reds have been discarded. I don't know exactly how many we get in all..I mean there's alot in there..I guess we get alot there's alot yeah, we're fine..This goes up one..I don't know..sinking the (--).Can I have three?.I don't think this should be too bad..Mmhmm..Whipering Garden..Maybe Howling garden..Oh good thing..Mmm, that was a good yeah, that was a good save..That was one..Lost Lagoon is gone..Gone.Ok..And Copper Gate is also gone..ta.oo ok..oh.ta.Good to know..Yeah.Alright let's see..Let's save both of these again maybe..Maybe.mmm.I am.that's because whispering garden's in the.And thats essentially I can do so..Two of these are in limbo..Yeah..Both of them are yeah..Yeah that's wise..One..So that's two actions..And you yeah that.And you need to get to the goal, the lion to.two.I'm not going for the lion.Oh, what are you going for?.I mean I guess I could. I was thinking the crystal made more sense since I already have two of them..ta.Ohhh.yeah.yeah I was.Well I could.wait.one.Two.(that was) two.yeah I would move there.Um, I'll go here.Oh wait what.Sounds good.Maybe if Coral Palace pops up.Yeah that's good..Alright.Oh you got a Helicopter Lift.Now I got the Lion, two ro five um so I have to get rid of one.Ok yeah we have a lot of Helicopter lifts.I want to keep this though.Get rid of the Chalice.yeah that's what I think.Fra.ta.I don't know why for some reason we're not going for that one this time..Mmhmmf.I have that one..It's.Ok..and.three.(--) way over there..Ah yes.Breaker's Bridge..Temple of the Moon..I always go for this one..We'll flip that..Hmm..And Howling Garden. So that's gone..Oh..That one's gone..That. That sucks..Oh good we saved the Whispering Garden then..Yeah that's ok though we're still in.Ok. What as my first move gonna be?.You're gray. You need to give..Oh to give you one of these ..Oh yeah.Oh yeah (--).Um.Please.And I would save this and give me that..ta.Ok and then I can save Crimson Forest as my third..ta that's good..Mmhmm..No cause you'd have to move there first..No cause you could only save it adjaecently..Oh I was thinking move here save this.Oh no moving is one, moving is one..That would end up being four turns total..Oh cause then you'd still have to give me..Sure..a thing.I'll give you this just because I can.Crimson Forest is.Crimson Forest can flood..Yeah that doesn't matter..Alright can you move?.So do that and then save this. That's your second action..Yeah.And then.move.Ah eh.I could.Sssah.Hmm..MMm..So right now the only chance of us getting this is Tidal Palace, so I don't think that's gonna happen.Ok you have to discard, sorry, I'm sorry. You have discard one of your cards..Oh I do I'm sorry..Oh yeah immediately..Um.Um.So maybe just.Stay like that.Yeah.I don't see any point in moving.Yeah there's not really anything else to do.I think so, yeah you don't have you don't need to go anywhere.Yeah.Oh.Of course I can do more of these.Oh that's good though..But I'd have to get to Tidal Palace somehow..No you can go to that one..You can get to Coral Palace which is close to Fool's landing..Oh true I didn't even see that one..Ok that'll be good..We'll make.(--).take three.Ok Cave of Embers.We have to get another one first..Ok Crimson Forest.Oh this one's gone..Oh.I was looking for the colors..And Cliffs of Abandon.Ooo ok, that's a bridge..You should.Yeah keep that.Watch out for that.Ok so I'm on.We do have a Sandbag.Temple of the Moon.I don't need to be there anymore..Right..if for.Ok so if we go for the.chalice.You're gonna get the Temple of the Moon. Yeah here's one..Is he red?.Yeah I'm red. So you could fly to me and.I would move..Yeah fly to him, give him that and then save this..So I'm gonna give you one of the crystals..Yeah let's.You're gonna have to give up something.Ok..I'll give up on the Lion I think. Cause I definitely want to keep the lift..Oh ok..That's one.And we only have two in the.Or three maybe that'll be ok..Two.Ok.Three.Yeah I mean I have three, I have two lifts..Hmm.As well.There we go.Oh look and then she just got, oh good..So you have to give up something..One oooh.Should I give this up?.Since you already have four yeah that'll be great..Cause you already have four.Yeah definitely get rid of that..Yeah cause that's, that's in the back..One, two, three, four, five perfect.Ok Coral Palace.Ttt Coral palace.Dunes of Deception.ta.I don't see Coral Pal-ph it's this one..That's it..Where is oh.And silver.When we're on it you can use the Sandbag for that.Gate.Move here (--).Silver Gate.Which one for Caves of Sha.Or.For what we're on.Oh that's a good idea. Should I use that now?.Only thing is if it does sink.We only have one.Then we have to move off of it..Hmmhmm.So yeah.So the cyrstal.I mean.Or Cave of Shadows, yeah to the fire thing.Yeah.So I mean yeah I don't know if.So A.It would be terrible if we lost right?.Well wait wait wait, let me think about it..Well wait wait wait, let me know.Maybe I'm not saying it I.Well that's the only one. I'm about to get that hopefully..Oooo so then we'd need it ok right right. Save it then,.One.That's the thing.Yeah I would save it. Save it..Wait wait wait but I can.Do you have one more action..No I don't have to..No I used all three of mine..K got it..Yeah I would.Yeah I would save it..Yeah that makes it yeah cause we definitely need that..K..Nice..Oh you're saying next time?.Ok so..Yeah next time. I thought you had one more action but you don't..I can get this one..Yeah um.So that's four and that's my first move..Mmhmm..That's one..Um.Maybe just work.Towards Fool's Landing..Can I give you.Are you blue?.ta.Yes.Yeah I was gonna do that and then maybe.If I had to I can give you the lion.Only thing about the Lion is.So just get to Cliffs?.I would have to give up one of mine but.But.We wanted to keep this but then if you give me the lion I'd be giving up the lion so.Yeah.I'll just, I'll just move closer cause that it'll.Open up a couple oppportunities.Ok.Mmhmm..Ok can I have.Two of those?.Before she gets to her turn you'll have a chance to give me the crystal or the.Yeah.Mmhmm. Ok..Chalice possibly so we won't need to worry about that..I have a chalice to..maybe.Temple of the Sun..Ok Temple of the Sun..Tidal Palace.And Bronze gate.Ok so I didn't lose any, Horah..Let's see..So all I need is one more..She has the flame..K..Do have card that like.You don't want to give up..There are three in jeopardy though and I know you can save two per round. That's what I'm thinkin'.Well we don't need to save that one cause I already have it.Oh true. True..Yeah we don't need to save either of those like if like if that were to go over..And you're not close enough..We don't really need to save either of these to be honest cause no one's going to be down here..I don't think.Yeah.Well.those one's that one maybe to get the lion.maybe.Yeah.No actually we would, we have to get it because.We have to get it cause the other one's gone..Because they're gone..Mmhmm..So I would save that one for sure..Mmk..And.And you have a Helicopter Lift card, yeah. So that'll be nice..Yeah I do.Maybe move to Cave of Shadows?.I'm thinking like move one, two, three..Yeah.That's right cause you can save both..Mmhmm..Yeah I would do that..One, two..One..Good..And I need a Treasure Card..Yeah..Oh watch out!.Water rise two, four, five. Now I only have to get rid of one thing..Every time!.Every time..Mmm..Like clock work..Well what was your other card?.You should get rid of the Helicopter lift, you already have one..Yeah I have two Helicopters..(--) turn..Yeah.(--) turn. I'll jsut take that back..You can't.imagine us flying that.Oh I can (--).(--) at this point..Don't draw Whispering Garden..I just realized that. Oh but we don't necessarily need that..I mean even if you draw Whispering Gardens it will be flooded it will still be here..Cause we still have two of those and we still have.Yeah.those two.So this goes up one.(--) ok we're still on three so that's good..We have 15 minutes left..Bronze Gate, Temple of the Sun, but that's out so it doesn't matter..and Tidal Palace. Oh tidal palace is gone. Oh are they all gone?.Mmhmm..Yeah.Bronze gate is out too.Tidal palace.Tidal Palace is ok.Is it ok?.Yeah.That was an unfortunate draw.Um.yeah oh well mmm..It would have been too much work to get to Tidal Palace and back.So you have Silver Gate.And move.I wouldn;t bother.Wouldn't bother? So just move towards.No I say just get to Coral Palce because.Yeah you don't really need to.Coral Palace.yeah.One , two.And then yeah I don't have any cards to give.Yeah.Oh nice.Oh perfect.So we just have to keep that alive for one turn.Ok.Can we succeed? And you still have three.yeah we got one, yeah I can one there now.Ok Coral Palace.Mmhmm.Oo that's terrifying.I'll save it.Oh sorry. yeah.No one has a Sandbag.Um Cliffs of Abandon.I can save it on my turn.Oh that was saved. I didn't realize that. And Breaker's Bridge..That's right over there..Ok..Ok so I'll save Coral Palace..Ok..Yeah so definitely do that. That's one move..And.And.And maybe work, should I go to Whispering Garden?.Yeah I was actually gonna say that cause I can give you this on my turn.Ok..So that was one. I would go two, three oh no but.two.you can fly.You gotta give me the flame crystal cause then I can give you the treasure.Well actually it depends on what you draw from the Treasure Cards.Yeah.Cause it could be either of us that get the treasure..ta.Oooo you talkin' about the Lion?.And you're actually closer. Yeah, yeah. I mean are you going with the lion?.Oh.It doesn't, it doesn't matter.which one are we not going for? we definitely have the chalice. It depends..We have that.(--) We have four.Well and I already have three..Flame cards.We should go for the crystal then and so not worry about the Whispering Garden but then what.What do I do.Um.you already did one thing..Uma.Yeah should I save Cities of Aba-- naaa.Yeah I would save Cliffs of Abandon, just in case something happens and then we lose that thing and then we can still get to there..Cliffs.Cliffs of Abandon.Alright, yeah Cliffs.Yeah.Are you gonna get anything? Cause you might just fly to fool's landing anyway..because we said.No I mean as long as we keep the Cave of Shadows alive and then he.gets there.Mmhmm.cause the Lion is the non priority right now.Yeah.Ok.but I also have yeah I.I mean I guess I'll just, I'll save and move to Fool's oh ok.Yeah so I would, I would just save that and then just stay where you or just move to there.

Yeah sure do it cause then we can end it now basically..Right..And then yeah cause then you would have to use the last one to get us off. Ok so.Yeah.MMhmm. Yeah cause I do have one..Ok.So move.I'm moving, well actually this'll be my turn cause I can fly to you.And then I'm.using the Helicopter lift to fly us there and then I'm using the other Helicopter Lift to fly the messenger..move us both.Oh no.Nnmm.Ok.And then you use.And then you need the Helicopter Lift to fly us off2.I have it though but we gotta go through these turns still.Yeah.Ok that's terrifying.So you need to get two treasure.You can't, now you can use that.Oh you can't just use at any point?.You can use it at any point..Oh to end the game even?.I think. I think you can..Oh that's right..Ok cool so..Yeah..Yeah..Game over..Nice..Hmm",s,%  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ^2  sd  b  %  %  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  ad  %  sd  sd  %  ba  sd  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  ad  b  ba  b  b  sd  %  ad  b  b  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  nn  b  fa  sd  b  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  %  %  qy  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  %  qy  fc  ad  %  %  sd  b  b  h  b  b  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  ny  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  %  sd  sd  b  b  bk  sd  b  qy  fc  b  sd  sd  b  qy  aa  ba  sd  %  aa  sd  aa  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  ba  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sv  aa  b  %  sd  qy  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  qy  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  %  sv  %  sd  sd  nn  b  sd  sd  sd  %  aa  b  sd  aa  sd  aa  sd  sd  nn  sd  sd  %  b  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sv  b  sd  sd  qw  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  aa  sd  aa  b  ad  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  qw  b  %  %  sd  sv  aa  sd  h  ba  sv  sd  sv  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  %  qw  sd  sd  bk  sd  %  qy  ba  sd  sd  b  b  aa  b  qy  sd  sd  qy  sd  qy  sd  sd  sv  qw  sd  %  sv  sd  sd  ba  sd  b  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  %  b^m  qy^d  %  qy  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  sd  sv  sd  qy  sv  sd  ba  b  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  qy  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  ba  %  sd  sd  sd  %  qh  b  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  ad  b  ba  ba  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  aa  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  ft  b  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  h  ^2  qy  sv  b  sd  qy  ba  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  %  b  b  %  ba  b  ^h  sv  aa  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  %  b  b  sd  sd  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  ba  sd  ba  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  %  sd  b  sd  %  b  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  b  sd  b  sd  ba  sd  sv  sd  sv  sd  b  b  %  %  sd  %  sd  ba  b  sv  aa  sd  sv  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sv  qy  ad  b  %  bf  b  sd  b  b  ba  sv  sd  fa  aa  %  %  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  b  b  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  ad  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  fc  sv  b  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sv  sd  qy  sv  sv  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  aa  qw  sd  sd  %  sd  b  qw  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  %  sd  %  sd  b  sd  %  sv  sd  oo_co_cc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  %  ba  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  ba  %  sv  sd  qy  qy  b  ny  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sv  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ^h  sd  sd  %  qy  sv  sd  sd  aa  sd  sv  sv  h  b  %  sd  aa  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  aa  qy  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  qw  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  b  b  sd  sd  sd  qy  b  sv  %  aa  sv  qy^d  sd  sd  sv  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  b  ba  ba  sd  b  qy  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sv  %  %  qy  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  sd  %  qy  qy  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  %  sd  %  qy  sd  sd  sd  fc  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  ba  sv  sd  sd  b  b  %  ba  sd  qw  sd  sd  sv  %  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  %  %  ba  %  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  %  ad  sd  sv  sd  %  sv  aa  bk  bk  sv  aa  nn  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  fa  sd  ba  %  b  b  sd  sv  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  ba  b  sd  ba  b  sd  aa  %  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  %  sv  b^m  sd  ad  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  fc  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  fc  sd  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  %  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  ad  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  aa  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  qy  ba  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  sv  aa  b  b  b  sd  ba  b,"Ok I'm . gonna start . same way as last time .  Shore these two up . (--) up here . shore these to up . Yeah hand me that . Treasure . Water's Rise . Hmm . ta that's . (--) . Mmm . And we're still at two . Whisepring Garden and . Cities of Abandon . Mmk . Ok . Ta alright um I'm going to . Maybe move to where closer to the temple of the moon . Um . Or actually no I'll . shore up this . And then . Mmm . (--) gonna shore up one more? . Yeah . Yeah you may as well . Or do I want to give one to you? . Um I already have two fires so I think I'm gonna go for the crystal . This purple one to you . ta . Oh yeah you should give me the purple on . Yeah . that's a good idea . ok . ok . So that's one more . And . maybe just stay put . sure . ta . Oh no I think that was three right? cause you moved . (--) shore it up . I shore up I gave . Wait where are you? Oh, you're Messenger, you're gray .  Ok never mind, so you're just going to stay the same . And she gave me that one . Yeah ok . Ok . I have the Lion, oh . Um, oh shoot oh wait, I have to do this first . Um . I don't want to use my (--) now . we're still at two . Breaker's Bridge and Phathom Rock . So this one . Oooh that's gone oh . gone . And Breaker's Bridge is over . Breaker's Bridge . No . ta . Oh sorry . It's the Phantom one that's gone .  It's ok . Ok . ta . K so . (--) the blue one . Maybe I should just yeah . I'm thinking I might move just work towards the lion I guess ifyou're gonna go for the chalice or the earth . Yeah that's what I was thinking to . (um) think . So maybe I'll do one . ta . or . is that one over there . Howling gar . and . Howling garden . Whispering Garden . Whispering Garden . Oh ok . Whispering (--) . But that's already been saved . Mmm Messenger's on the (--) ok I'll . I'll . Should I just . Yeah just stay there, that's fine . Go on it . Um . Mm . I'll should I just stick with two moves? . Sure . Yeah . I don't know (--) . Ok . hmm . So I draw . two, another Helicopter lift a crystal . Lost Lagoon . And . And Gold Gate . And GOld Gate . Ah this one, it's gone it's ok . Oh it's gone . ta . Ok so I'll save this one . And then . They're already saying I got those two . And i can give you this in the next one . Are you gray? . Yes . Well she's the Messenger so she can just give it to you . Oh that's right, that's right .  So I wanted to use that . Yeah . So you might as well just . Get on the Temple . Ah . You're green . I don't know why I can, you're even wearing green . Hmm . So I did one . And this is . two . My second . Hmm . Hmm . Ok cool . And then I can end . yeah . can i have two moe? . Thank you . Ok . Temple of the Moon . And Iron gate . Hmm . Should I use my Sandbag to do Temple of the Moon right now? . Yeah I would say so . Mmm . Mm no I would save it . cause it's in the . Yeah ok actually you're right . I'm pretty likely to get a Water's Rise I think so . yeah you're right,you're right . Ok . right . oh yeah put that there and save it ok . when do you guys think I should save these? . ta . What you have the crystals? . Like I wouldnt care about this, but this would be pretty important . yeah I would save this one . save that one . maybe save that one and work towards cave of shadows . yeah . yeah um . no, might as well save both if I can . Two . three . yeah good idea . wait cna you save . Ok . I'm the engineer . He his power is that he can save two . Oh, ok . Look at that Water's Rise . Oh good call . oh . Always get water's rise . Hmm . Oh move that up, so now we're at three already . So now we're at three ok . Temple of the moon . Oh . Oh . Lost Lagoon and Iron Gate . Alright so Iron Gate's gone . That's not that important right? . yeah it doesn't matter . ok . Um so now . You should give me that . You should give, do you want to get rid of your red? . No cause I need the red, oh but you're so far away shoot . So maybe keep this? . Well . Mmm, well closer a little bit here . ta . I say get rid of her red . Get rid of her red cause you have a red . Are you, you're kind of close to the gold to so I'd stick with . I'd get rid of the red . Yeah actually that's probably a good idea . We and we hav emore gold than the purple .  Cause I have a gold and you have a gold . Yeah . We currently have four reds though out . ta . Yeah but she's not . oh yeah . We have four golds, we have three purples . Is purple really im . Mmm it's kind of important . Well . Cause she's on (--) . It's just because I already have two . No . right . and she's on it .  I mean you could easily draw . Any of us could draw another purple . Any time and then be able to give it to her . (--) . true . Yeah . I can't really do anything else at this point so I don't know . yeah I . would cause I'm already here to, so all I would have to do is . yeah that's true . flip it if I got another one . unless i want to move . no ok . I was gonna more closer to where . I have . Something but . mhmm . ta . I can do that as well . well if she goes . wait . I just can't save lost lagoon but that doesn't really matter at this point . It doesn't matter if we lose that . Mm . Don't want risk the red . One, two . ok so what treasures are we going after . the . the purple? . oh I wish that you could . diagonally do something because then if you had just moved one two oh no that wouldn't work anyways . Yeah . Also I'm red . Oh that's right . oh yeah I'm gray . oh that's right . oh . then you should save this . Oh yeah, I would move one over and then save this, and then give me that . save this . sounds good . we can do that . Ok so one over and then you save this and that's two and that's three . save that yeah and then that'll be . And then which one should I get rid of? . oh . Um . probably ll . I would get rid of red, oh . well it kinda doesn't matter there's even odds either way I think . yeah I was gonna say . I want to say red, just because I already have two . so if by chance I don't know . that's just . Either way you're gonn have to get rid of another one .  When another one comes along . In my heart . Yeah I think (--) is good . Ok and then I'll take these two .  Oh I got another Sandbag . another purple . oh good . I'm taking three of these . Ah Whispering Garden . ta . Where is oh thank .  Cliffs of Abandon . right next to it . and Breaker's Bridge . ok oh ok . oh my gosh they're all on a row . ta . we'll ahve to watch out for that .  Should I use another Sandbag for whispering garden? . mmm . No save it for now . She's already on this one so . Ok . alright . true . Soooommm . Should I . (--) so I can fly to places . you can fly anywhere . should i fly over to you? . you can only do it once a turn though . is the thing . ok right, yeah, but we don't have that many like li . that that's the trick cause I was thinking the same thing . I guess she's not gonn abe able to give . why . like she's not gonna be in the position to give me a card .  So what I was thinking is . Mm . unless you move yourself .  You could . Oh yeah and you can go anywhere on the board . You know I would move, because if you move then she can give a lion away and she'll have room for one more purple . yeah that's a good idea actually . cause otherwise we're gonna lose a Lion when she gets another card cause she's at max . oh ok . so . I'll fly over to you and then . and that counts as an action, you flying . Mmhmm . you fly over to m . to me . and then on your turn you would . I can give you both of these . give me both and then you (--) so I'll do that . Ah cause I could always fly back to . good . I mean I could fly at any time back to the Hollowing . One . garden . or the whispering garden . unless . if that's not, is that permanent? . no she said it doesn't be to be . Ok so if we if you flew over here you could s or . Oh now you cant move dianonally, never mind .  I was gonna try to save this one but . if it's not as important . Oh . or save this one cause then you're already closer . but then you wouldn't have enough moves . well i could fly to here save that one and then move to her . yeah that's what I was thinking but is Cliffs of Abandon important? . This one's more important . Yeah but she can't move diagonally I don't think .  So that's . Mmm . yeah . I mean it could be mmm . No cause it either . Nnmm . To get to Flood's Fool's landing would be the same difference . same number of moves . Do we save it just . Do we save it just because? . we can . mine as well .  I don;t think I'm going to do anything else with the move . So you flew over to there yeah .  Saved there . But if I fly here . MM . Oh yeah we'll say you flew there so that's one . That's two . Saved and then I'll move to you . And then back is three . And then he moved . Ok . oK . Mmm . and now . Ew, I may have to discard a card to . Just fine . I can get rid of this one or the (--) . well . Well get rid of the chalice because . yeah c . If you give her the . Um . purple thing . She can get the treasure . Mmhmm . Well she has the purple to like we . I'll have . yeah get rid of the chalice . MMk . Mmm . That's reasonable . Ok and then those guys . ta . Copper gate . Tss . Howling garden . And Crimson forest . Crimson Forest . This one right up here . Oh yeah . This one . Ok so . Well maybe move diagonally and save Copper Gate and Crimson Forest . That's what I was thinking to . Yeah I would go . But then you would be on it . No but I can go back . Yeah . Cause I can move diagonally . Oh true . So . One . One save this . Mmhmm . Go bck . That's what I would do . Yep . Right? . Ok . And can I have that? . two of these . Ahhh . Dang it . Ok so that has to be played and I'll just discard that . Yeah I'll shuffle 'em . Ok . cause we have one, two, three open . I guess I can take that one too . oh yeah thank you . Mmhmm . We keeping track of how many? . I think . So two reds have been discarded .  I don't know exactly how many we get in all . I mean there's alot in there . I guess we get alot there's alot yeah, we're fine . This goes up one . I don't know . sinking the (--) . Can I have three? . I don't think this should be too bad . Mmhmm . Whipering Garden . Maybe Howling garden . Oh good thing . Mmm, that was a good yeah, that was a good save . That was one . Lost Lagoon is gone . Gone . Ok . And Copper Gate is also gone . ta . oo ok . oh . ta . Good to know . Yeah . Alright let's see . Let's save both of these again maybe . Maybe . mmm . I am . that's because whispering garden's in the . And thats essentially I can do so . Two of these are in limbo . Yeah . Both of them are yeah . Yeah that's wise . One . So that's two actions . And you yeah that . And you need to get to the goal, the lion to . two . I'm not going for the lion . Oh, what are you going for? . I mean I guess I could .  I was thinking the crystal made more sense since I already have two of them . ta . Ohhh . yeah . yeah I was . Well I could . wait . one . Two . (that was) two . yeah I would move there . Um, I'll go here . Oh wait what . Sounds good . Maybe if Coral Palace pops up . Yeah that's good . Alright . Oh you got a Helicopter Lift . Now I got the Lion, two ro five um so I have to get rid of one . Ok yeah we have a lot of Helicopter lifts . I want to keep this though . Get rid of the Chalice . yeah that's what I think . Fra . ta . I don't know why for some reason we're not going for that one this time . Mmhmmf . I have that one . It's . Ok . and . three . (--) way over there . Ah yes . Breaker's Bridge . Temple of the Moon . I always go for this one . We'll flip that . Hmm . And Howling Garden .  So that's gone . Oh . That one's gone . That .  That sucks . Oh good we saved the Whispering Garden then . Yeah that's ok though we're still in . Ok .  What as my first move gonna be? . You're gray .  You need to give . Oh to give you one of these  . Oh yeah . Oh yeah (--) . Um . Please . And I would save this and give me that . ta . Ok and then I can save Crimson Forest as my third . ta that's good . Mmhmm . No cause you'd have to move there first . No cause you could only save it adjaecently . Oh I was thinking move here save this . Oh no moving is one, moving is one . That would end up being four turns total . Oh cause then you'd still have to give me . Sure . a thing . I'll give you this just because I can . Crimson Forest is . Crimson Forest can flood . Yeah that doesn't matter . Alright can you move? . So do that and then save this .  That's your second action . Yeah . And then . move . Ah eh . I could . Sssah . Hmm . MMm . So right now the only chance of us getting this is Tidal Palace, so I don't think that's gonna happen . Ok you have to discard, sorry, I'm sorry .  You have discard one of your cards . Oh I do I'm sorry . Oh yeah immediately . Um . Um . So maybe just . Stay like that . Yeah . I don't see any point in moving . Yeah there's not really anything else to do . I think so, yeah you don't have you don't need to go anywhere . Yeah . Oh . Of course I can do more of these . Oh that's good though . But I'd have to get to Tidal Palace somehow . No you can go to that one . You can get to Coral Palace which is close to Fool's landing . Oh true I didn't even see that one . Ok that'll be good . We'll make . (--) . take three . Ok Cave of Embers . We have to get another one first . Ok Crimson Forest . Oh this one's gone . Oh . I was looking for the colors . And Cliffs of Abandon . Ooo ok, that's a bridge . You should . Yeah keep that . Watch out for that . Ok so I'm on . We do have a Sandbag . Temple of the Moon . I don't need to be there anymore . Right . if for . Ok so if we go for the . chalice . You're gonna get the Temple of the Moon .  Yeah here's one . Is he red? . Yeah I'm red .  So you could fly to me and . I would move . Yeah fly to him, give him that and then save this . So I'm gonna give you one of the crystals . Yeah let's . You're gonna have to give up something . Ok . I'll give up on the Lion I think .  Cause I definitely want to keep the lift . Oh ok . That's one . And we only have two in the . Or three maybe that'll be ok . Two . Ok . Three . Yeah I mean I have three, I have two lifts . Hmm . As well . There we go . Oh look and then she just got, oh good . So you have to give up something . One oooh . Should I give this up? . Since you already have four yeah that'll be great . Cause you already have four . Yeah definitely get rid of that . Yeah cause that's, that's in the back . One, two, three, four, five perfect . Ok Coral Palace . Ttt Coral palace . Dunes of Deception . ta . I don't see Coral Pal-ph it's this one . That's it . Where is oh . And silver . When we're on it you can use the Sandbag for that . Gate . Move here (--) . Silver Gate . Which one for Caves of Sha . Or . For what we're on . Oh that's a good idea .  Should I use that now? . Only thing is if it does sink . We only have one . Then we have to move off of it . Hmmhmm . So yeah . So the cyrstal . I mean . Or Cave of Shadows, yeah to the fire thing . Yeah . So I mean yeah I don't know if . So A . It would be terrible if we lost right? . Well wait wait wait, let me think about it . Well wait wait wait, let me know . Maybe I'm not saying it I . Well that's the only one .  I'm about to get that hopefully . Oooo so then we'd need it ok right right .  Save it then, . One . That's the thing . Yeah I would save it .  Save it . Wait wait wait but I can . Do you have one more action . No I don't have to . No I used all three of mine . K got it . Yeah I would . Yeah I would save it . Yeah that makes it yeah cause we definitely need that . K . Nice . Oh you're saying next time? . Ok so . Yeah next time .  I thought you had one more action but you don't . I can get this one . Yeah um . So that's four and that's my first move . Mmhmm . That's one . Um . Maybe just work . Towards Fool's Landing . Can I give you . Are you blue? . ta . Yes . Yeah I was gonna do that and then maybe . If I had to I can give you the lion . Only thing about the Lion is . So just get to Cliffs? . I would have to give up one of mine but . But . We wanted to keep this but then if you give me the lion I'd be giving up the lion so . Yeah . I'll just, I'll just move closer cause that it'll . Open up a couple oppportunities . Ok . Mmhmm . Ok can I have . Two of those? . Before she gets to her turn you'll have a chance to give me the crystal or the . Yeah . Mmhmm .  Ok . Chalice possibly so we won't need to worry about that . I have a chalice to . maybe . Temple of the Sun . Ok Temple of the Sun . Tidal Palace . And Bronze gate . Ok so I didn't lose any, Horah . Let's see . So all I need is one more . She has the flame . K . Do have card that like . You don't want to give up . There are three in jeopardy though and I know you can save two per round .  That's what I'm thinkin' . Well we don't need to save that one cause I already have it . Oh true .  True . Yeah we don't need to save either of those like if like if that were to go over . And you're not close enough . We don't really need to save either of these to be honest cause no one's going to be down here . I don't think . Yeah . Well . those one's that one maybe to get the lion . maybe . Yeah . No actually we would, we have to get it because . We have to get it cause the other one's gone . Because they're gone . Mmhmm . So I would save that one for sure . Mmk . And . And you have a Helicopter Lift card, yeah .  So that'll be nice . Yeah I do . Maybe move to Cave of Shadows? . I'm thinking like move one, two, three . Yeah . That's right cause you can save both . Mmhmm . Yeah I would do that . One, two . One . Good . And I need a Treasure Card . Yeah . Oh watch out! . Water rise two, four, five .  Now I only have to get rid of one thing . Every time! . Every time . Mmm . Like clock work . Well what was your other card? . You should get rid of the Helicopter lift, you already have one . Yeah I have two Helicopters . (--) turn . Yeah . (--) turn .  I'll jsut take that back . You can't . imagine us flying that . Oh I can (--) . (--) at this point . Don't draw Whispering Garden . I just realized that .  Oh but we don't necessarily need that . I mean even if you draw Whispering Gardens it will be flooded it will still be here . Cause we still have two of those and we still have . Yeah . those two . So this goes up one . (--) ok we're still on three so that's good . We have 15 minutes left . Bronze Gate, Temple of the Sun, but that's out so it doesn't matter . and Tidal Palace .  Oh tidal palace is gone .  Oh are they all gone? . Mmhmm . Yeah . Bronze gate is out too . Tidal palace . Tidal Palace is ok . Is it ok? . Yeah . That was an unfortunate draw . Um . yeah oh well mmm . It would have been too much work to get to Tidal Palace and back . So you have Silver Gate . And move . I wouldn;t bother . Wouldn't bother? So just move towards . No I say just get to Coral Palce because . Yeah you don't really need to . Coral Palace . yeah . One , two . And then yeah I don't have any cards to give . Yeah . Oh nice . Oh perfect . So we just have to keep that alive for one turn . Ok . Can we succeed? And you still have three . yeah we got one, yeah I can one there now . Ok Coral Palace . Mmhmm . Oo that's terrifying . I'll save it . Oh sorry .  yeah . No one has a Sandbag . Um Cliffs of Abandon . I can save it on my turn . Oh that was saved .  I didn't realize that .  And Breaker's Bridge . That's right over there . Ok . Ok so I'll save Coral Palace . Ok . Yeah so definitely do that .  That's one move . And . And . And maybe work, should I go to Whispering Garden? . Yeah I was actually gonna say that cause I can give you this on my turn . Ok . So that was one .  I would go two, three oh no but . two . you can fly . You gotta give me the flame crystal cause then I can give you the treasure . Well actually it depends on what you draw from the Treasure Cards . Yeah . Cause it could be either of us that get the treasure . ta . Oooo you talkin' about the Lion? . And you're actually closer .  Yeah, yeah .  I mean are you going with the lion? . Oh . It doesn't, it doesn't matter . which one are we not going for? we definitely have the chalice .  It depends . We have that . (--) We have four . Well and I already have three . Flame cards . We should go for the crystal then and so not worry about the Whispering Garden but then what . What do I do . Um . you already did one thing . Uma . Yeah should I save Cities of Aba-- naaa . Yeah I would save Cliffs of Abandon, just in case something happens and then we lose that thing and then we can still get to there . Cliffs . Cliffs of Abandon . Alright, yeah Cliffs . Yeah . Are you gonna get anything? Cause you might just fly to fool's landing anyway . because we said . No I mean as long as we keep the Cave of Shadows alive and then he . gets there . Mmhmm . cause the Lion is the non priority right now . Yeah . Ok . but I also have yeah I . I mean I guess I'll just, I'll save and move to Fool's oh ok . Yeah so I would, I would just save that and then just stay where you or just move to there .  It doesn't really matter . Maybe I'll just stay there just in case I have to give you some- oh Let's just stay there . Yeah that's good ok so . That's good . This is your second move and then end it . save that's the second . Yeah then I'll just stay .  Ok thanks . Ok . Ok . Oo Sandbag and . Oh good . So Sandbag and the chalice .  I'm getting rid of the chalice cause you have them and we can . Alright what do you want to get rid of? . Get rid of both of the chalices cause she already has 'em . Yeah two, cause I already have four . And then that'll be good . And then . use a sandbag . ta . Silver Gate which is gone . Silver gate oh is gone . Cave of Embers is gone which is ok and then Temple of the Moon . is flooded . Ok my turn . So . One two three . So you just need to get to Messenger . I can get to you and give you him and give you this . (wait) . Ok so . Whoops . Op . Whaoo . It's my water bottle sorry . One . And . the recording thing . Hopefully it's still working . Ok . One . Two . Two . And give it a . Give you this and then save this maybe? . Three . Well that's three . No that was three . Just . That's your third . Oh that's right . Ok cool . Ok cool . And so we're not going for the Lion right? Right .  So get rid of that . Yeah I think that's . No . Yeah get rid of that cause now you already have it . Ok . ta . And three of those . There's three . Misty Marsh . Whispering Garden's Misty Marsh . (--) And um . And . Dunes of Deception . Dunes . Ok so them just move us there . Since it's gone now .  Oh just kidding . No it's just flooded . Sorry . So take this back . Nice . (--) . Ok so . Yeah . I'm actually gonna . You may as well . Yeah . So that's one . Whoops . Two . And then get it . three . Mmhmm . Mmm . Alright . Well that's what I figured . Oh (--) ooo . Ohhh . We gotta get this chalice quick . I know . (--) . Ok . So I got four of them .  One two . Four oh . Three . Oh God this is terrifying . Four . Dunes of Deception a . Temple of the Moon is gone . Ok but that doesn't matter . Whispering Garden is gone . which also doesn't really matter .  Misty Marsh is gone . It's a no cause we have . Ok . Ok . No you just have to get the chalice . Alright . And then you can hop to Fool's . which is happening now . Yeah . I'm just gonna start my move if that's ok . Yeah go for it . Yeah . Yeah I'm done so . So that's one . Can I grab that? Is that two or one? . That's one and then I'll move to . Fool's Landing . Which one are you gray? . ta . I think you should move . gray . No move to Fools' Landing, cause we have all three treasures now . Yeah move to Fool's Landing . Yeah . Two . I could move, not wait wait . And yeah you can end . No Water rise . oh yeah yeah continue . I was thinking . Four . Hmm . Don't forget it's four . I think I should move . Yeah . Thanks . Dunes of Deception is flooded .  That's fine . Ok Coral Palace this is flooded . Thank you . Ah Cliffs of Abandon . Ok Breaker's Bridge . and Watchtower . Ok we're good . Ok I think we can win . If I move . to if I fly to . Dunes of Deception . And then take you with the Helicopter Lift . Mmhmm . Oh no if I move . Like so . Could I . You could move . You could fly to here . yeah . grab . take her . to Fool's Landing . with myself right? . MMhmm . Cause you will have a Helicopter Lift . yeah . I can just use another Helicopter Lift to . And then just wait out the turn . Yeah . Well cause these don't count as my turn . Right . Yeah that's true . So then I could move to . So you may as well and then don't risk . Dunes of Deception . Drag us both to Fool's Landing . Use this other card to . Grab you . Messenger . Might as well . To Fool's Landing . Oh right I forgot that I can move me even if you're not on the same space .  Yeah sure do it cause then we can end it now basically . Right . And then yeah cause then you would have to use the last one to get us off .  Ok so . Yeah . MMhmm .  Yeah cause I do have one . Ok . So move . I'm moving, well actually this'll be my turn cause I can fly to you . And then I'm . using the Helicopter lift to fly us there and then I'm using the other Helicopter Lift to fly the messenger . move us both . Oh no . Nnmm . Ok . And then you use . And then you need the Helicopter Lift to fly us off2 . I have it though but we gotta go through these turns still . Yeah . Ok that's terrifying . So you need to get two treasure . You can't, now you can use that . Oh you can't just use at any point? . You can use it at any point . Oh to end the game even? . I think .  I think you can . Oh that's right . Ok cool so . Yeah . Yeah . Game over . Nice .

Team2401.csv,"Ok so basically.Alright.Ok so..We're just trying to move. Oh sorry..Um.We're trying to move all the cards.to me since I can just go anywhere..And you're tyring to get all the same cards to her so she can send them to me..Sure.So since you have those blue ones why don't you shoot for getting me here..MMhmm. That..So.You can shore up.two for any move that you make right?.One two.So why don't ou move like one, two.One, two and then move here and shore up..And then..Two..There two right?.These two.These two.Cause I'm so close to these that I can do those..Ok so that's one action..That's three total um.Right.No.Oh yeah..Yeah this..Right.Yeah.So.We need to.Wait why'd you shore up this?.Because then we just have more.Cards in the.One ah just like this one..Pile.Um because I'm, so close to that one..I can shore up these two next turn.Ok..Yeah she can do that anyway..Water Rise.Already so fast.Already.Here.Right..Let me shuffle these before you.Oh yeah..Draw your three..And we'll see..Because now this one might be sunk..Right..Watch that they sunk(--) Lost Lagoon.Alright..Good..Oh yeah over there..Sss yeah wow..Cities of Abandon.This one is gone..Ok..Here you go..Ooo.yeah.Phanthom Rock..is.gone.gone.Wow.here.Oh yeah I'll take that..Ok.Ok so um..That's my (--).So I guess I will move this way..Shore up this one..Mmm..And then I still have another..(--) left and.Should we try to stay on the same card now or.Hater.Why don't I give you this so that you have..Two each and then.You can just try and get this one first and then move down to this one..Sure.And you should.Um.You're giving your two cards to someone else..Since you can't have two matches ever.(tough).So you you should either only hold on to these two or these two..I'll stay on the same, I'll stay on the same thing as you so you can just give me one of your actions..Oh.Yeah.Yeah.So I have one of these and one of these..So I guess I'll be taking on the challenge of the Lion..Which is really close to where you'll be going so good..Ok..So two cards (--) there..And then.I just drew those two..Oh right ok yeah yeah..These two..And.Wait did I draw three?.Godl Gate.Yes..(--).What the last one you drew?.Um.Lost Lagoon..She accidentally drew three instead of two.Yeah.Can I just.Can we flip it back up like one of them?.Ok so I'll just put Lost Lagoon back on top.Yeah.Top or just shuffle it..Right..Or just top.I I think just.(--).Yes.Top.Well Lost Lagoon (--) Lost Lagoon would have been down anyways now beacuse I would have just drawn it..Yeah so just put the second one back..Yeah..So.Ok..I can't remember which one I drew second..It's ok, just.put one back.Yeah.Alright well.Well Gold Gate is sunken.Ok..Ok..Cool..Alright cause we gotta do better than this. We gotta keep track of..I've already ear-earned our things..Ah it's your go.ta.Whispering.Hmm..two times.Ch Ch Ch.Oh at this point, it doens't really matter..So I should go here so then she can send them to me eventually.And.That's one..I'm not sure there's anything else to do..So yeah..Just pick cards.Ok.Ok.Well then I need the flood cards then yeah.Two.Breaker's Bridge.Oh no.And Temple of the Moon. That's that one..Hah.Oh no.Ha.Ok.I'm a curse it's me..And that's not..Ok my turn right?.Yeah.Yeah you can.Shore up two right?.I was just gonna go here and I would shore up these two..You can't.Or you move.Why don't you shore up these two yeah.Or shoudl or shoudl these two yeah instead.Wait.So she can shore up two things per turn. She's right there so.Yeah.So she should shore up that..Those are adjacent..And they can move here..Um.Yeah.Right..Well that might not be the best strategy. I think you should be getting rid of your two fires and or your two goblets because there's no point in you having.That that's.What should I.Two sets of two.Cause that means you'll either have to discard.You know something from like our collective. I think you should.Move.Well you have.Three actions right?.Right right so I'm waiting on one more..Right so why don't you move to the.That's what I was gonna say, just move here and whatever card comes.(--).Move to that spot and get the.Treasure.Beacuse if I get two I'd get six right, so I'd have to get rid of two..Yeah.Depends on what it is, it can be anything..So you just have to get rid of one..Right, one yeah..Oh yeah..So.Yeha but if you gave.So I can give you cards at any time in the game so why don't you move to.Mmhmm..Right that.Yeah but you should be giving me cards because I can move anywhere that would make much more sense and then you shoudl be giving you cards to her because she can send them to me.Your spot.And I can move anywhere.Why don't you just move to the spot and give me.But right now it it.Like your.Goblet and I can give it back to you if you every give.You want me to give it.Ok.Get another one or something.We'd have to be in the same place as well so you just told me to give you the gullet.I I don't have to be in the same place as you, not that's my power that I can just give.Ok so just one..Whichever one.you want to do.I would say Coral place just cause.You can just stay there until you get another fire.So ok so you're saying just give you onw. That's the best option..I think so.ta.Let's just let's just take one.or no.I would think give her two.Oh.I don't think I can give two yet.She can't.That would be two turns.It's one per action.Yeah.Give a single yeah.You have to.Oh you have to.Oh i'm not standing on the same place.Exactly so you would have to move.Ok let me just move here.To her.Right.Ok that's fine.Or I can.No I would just move here.I mean I can follow you I can move two spots on my next turn.Yeah ok.Can you give me two?.Yeah.And then you draw two of these.Ok I'd have to discard one.Right.So.Whispering Garden.Up here.Mmhmm.Iron Gate.Over here.Ok.Yeah we're done. Ok so your turn.Alright so it's my turn.MMhmm..So I'm just gonna move here, shore this up.And then move here.Ok so we're in the same place.So I can be on the same tile.Ok..Hmm I think you should just.first send those two to me.those two actions.Which ones?.Yeah.And then.I mean it's right here. I can get down here..Those two..Yeah but we want to free up.your.Like we want yours freed up so we can send them to someone..Should I just.Then I can't be on the same spot as her.to get her cards, you realize that?.I'd have to be on the same thing as her to get her cards a.Yeah.yeah.So if you.Send those two to me. That's two turns.And I can't shore up anything now.You can use this to shore up something.True.What are we trying to send.Oh wait. Right? That.Even that card never mindIt has to be on an adjacent space..I mean I would do that one up there but.It doesn't.I mean I have three, you have one right?.Oh yeah.So.If you're on that card I could give them to you on my turn, so that would be fine..Yeah I think she should send these two..Right.Well he can give on his turn, he can give you the last one..Three, four, five.Ok.Yeah.I'd have to.be down there though.But he would have to, he would have to no. He could just go to your spot..Wait, you don't have to be in the same place as I am to give me cards.I do she doesn't..you.She ok.So.Wait so I would have to be in.I propose that I do what he said.about.um.giving him the two cards or whatever.and then.just moving one spot.two.yeah.there.anywhere.wherever and.just closer to you.and then.on his next turn he should move to the same spot you're in..And give you that last fourth card.He would have to move here we'd have to.And then on your turn you should move here.ok.Ok.So on your next turn you should move here and then give her your last card and then she can move and get one..yeah.Ok.So this is two actions.One more.Um.This one.And is everybody ok if I use this to shore up?.Mmhmm..Whispering Garden or.Um no.You're gonna wait.Or you wanna stay there? Ok..For later.We should.Yeah we can just wait for later for that.Ok.Wait is there another.Um Lion one somewhere?.Lion.You're on it..So it's unecessary. Whispering Garden doesn't matter..Yeah.Right..So.I'm gonna draw my two cards..You could.Oh yeah you could have shored.Water Rise's.We should save it for when we need it..And they're dissapearing..So on your turn you move to where she is.Give her.One of those and then do whatever for your third turn..Ok so I'll shuffle that up..Oh yeah..One two..Three.Iron Gate.Is gone..Breaker's Bridge.is.sunk. It's the one that I'm on.oh.And Lost Lagoon is gone.Lost Lagoon.Ok.Ok..Your turn.Yes.Yeah so.Move one, give one..right..So move up here. give me the.No he should move here.Alright..he.which color are you?.Oh yeah you'd have to go.red.So you'd have to just use two and then just give me the one..Oh ok..Nope.Just one because it's his power to travel.I can travel.Oh ok..So that's one..And then give her this..And then give you this.Then you have to.And unshore this or whatever.one, two, three, four, you have to discard one.More than five.Nope that's five..You have only five cards.One, two, three, four five six.Oh yeah discard.Oh six oh ok..Just discard one of the fires.So then you need a third turn or you can just draw two..Yeah..Thanks.Ok draw two..Ok.Ok so.Ok.And you draw.Three more.One two.Three.Good by Whispering Garden definitely.Not red..Oh here.Yeah.Ah Temple of the sun.And.And put them.Ok so.Ok.Ok.So.your go.Wait.So you move one first.What's wrong.One, two, three, four, five, six.You have more than five. Get rid of one of these..ta oh.Or a Sandbag, I guess it doens't matter.I would say sand.No because my special power is already moving then having two Helicopter Lifts, well..Yes, get rid of the Sandbag.Yeha get rid of the Sandbag.She already has one anyways.Cause if you have to move both of us.Ok.And I need oh yeah I already did the one I think ok go ahead.Yeah.Yeah.Ok so give me oh here it is.why is this.you could just move that.Oh to.yeah.somewhere else.Ok.doesnt' matter.Um there you go.so that was one.so then you have.two more things that you can do.you never moved here.Oh ok yeah, so move there so two um.oh.This one, that's two moves.I don't.you want to shore up that?.Nope, can't do that.Oh yeah.Why not, why not?.Beacuse you can't that's too many..That's two more moves.So.Oh yeah.So I don't.I can.Yeah no I can to.I guess.You should try to move closer to the space where she's gotten to be.to exchange cards.so.what's the next treasure?.So move back here..I have three of these. What do you have?.I don't I just have.Fire.(--).whatever.Ok.move back here then.Ok.And then it's my turn.Yeah.Um right.Wait no I have to get two cards.Yeah.As well as three of these.Oh yeah.Ok.Ok.Right?.Yeah three.So three, one, two, three ok..Yeah.Tidal Palace.Copper Gate.And Crimson Forest.Yeah I got it.Ok.Ok so my go I'm shore this.Cause I'm right next to it..Ok.Ok.So that's one..Mmm.um.No treasures or anything so just.No.I'm on the same one as you..Yeah.Yeah..Ah.(--).One so that's it?.And.You.Ok wait let's just ok yeah.And you (--) so pick two.We just have to make sure there's at least one for each of these that's not flooded ok..Right.MMhmm..oh Water Rises sorry guys.(--).yeah.I realized I was shoveling them while looking at them which is an ineffective practice.Shovel the whole deck.Wait what.You can't do that (--) no.No.Copper Gate.It's always Copper Gate.It's gone.Oh yeah.ok..I'll take the card.Temple of.the Moon.Copper Gate.Crimson Forest is gone..Ok..Ok..Ah this one yeah..Ok.Ok.(--).So.So it's your go, so can we try to keep Temple of the Moon?.Just because it's so close to where we all are.And Temple of the Sun yeah.One of the two.One of those.And it's right at the top one of them.This one's going to be on the top so.Yeah.Look in those few cards that I shuffled..Hmm..Ok then I guess we should probably keep this one since it's.If you want.Yeah closer to the Fools Landing.Alright.So I guess.Oh no wait, I can't go anywhere.Don't move from that place, yeah stay at your place..Yeah.Why can't he go anywhere?.Because.She said give that to me.We have to get this treasure but wait don't we have to have.To like beyond this one..Why don't you fly there, shore it and fly back..

Alright . Ok so . We're just trying to move .  Oh sorry . Um . We're trying to move all the cards . to me since I can just go anywhere . And you're tyring to get all the same cards to her so she can send them to me . Sure . So since you have those blue ones why don't you shoot for getting me here . MMhmm .  That . So . You can shore up . two for any move that you make right? . One two . So why don't ou move like one, two . One, two and then move here and shore up . And then . Two . There two right? . These two . These two . Cause I'm so close to these that I can do those . Ok so that's one action . That's three total um . Right . No . Oh yeah . Yeah this . Right . Yeah . So . We need to . Wait why'd you shore up this? . Because then we just have more . Cards in the . One ah just like this one . Pile . Um because I'm, so close to that one . I can shore up these two next turn . Ok . Yeah she can do that anyway . Water Rise . Already so fast . Already . Here . Right . Let me shuffle these before you . Oh yeah . Draw your three . And we'll see . Because now this one might be sunk . Right . Watch that they sunk(--) Lost Lagoon . Alright . Good . Oh yeah over there . Sss yeah wow . Cities of Abandon . This one is gone . Ok . Here you go . Ooo . yeah . Phanthom Rock . is . gone . gone . Wow . here . Oh yeah I'll take that . Ok . Ok so um . That's my (--) . So I guess I will move this way . Shore up this one . Mmm . And then I still have another . (--) left and . Should we try to stay on the same card now or . Hater . Why don't I give you this so that you have . Two each and then . You can just try and get this one first and then move down to this one . Sure . And you should . Um . You're giving your two cards to someone else . Since you can't have two matches ever . (tough) . So you you should either only hold on to these two or these two . I'll stay on the same, I'll stay on the same thing as you so you can just give me one of your actions . Oh . Yeah . Yeah . So I have one of these and one of these . So I guess I'll be taking on the challenge of the Lion . Which is really close to where you'll be going so good . Ok . So two cards (--) there . And then . I just drew those two . Oh right ok yeah yeah . These two . And . Wait did I draw three? . Godl Gate . Yes . (--) . What the last one you drew? . Um . Lost Lagoon . She accidentally drew three instead of two . Yeah . Can I just . Can we flip it back up like one of them? . Ok so I'll just put Lost Lagoon back on top . Yeah . Top or just shuffle it . Right . Or just top . I I think just . (--) . Yes . Top . Well Lost Lagoon (--) Lost Lagoon would have been down anyways now beacuse I would have just drawn it . Yeah so just put the second one back . Yeah . So . Ok . I can't remember which one I drew second . It's ok, just . put one back . Yeah . Alright well . Well Gold Gate is sunken . Ok . Ok . Cool . Alright cause we gotta do better than this .  We gotta keep track of . I've already ear-earned our things . Ah it's your go . ta . Whispering . Hmm . two times . Ch Ch Ch . Oh at this point, it doens't really matter . So I should go here so then she can send them to me eventually . And . That's one . I'm not sure there's anything else to do . So yeah . Just pick cards . Ok . Ok . Well then I need the flood cards then yeah . Two . Breaker's Bridge . Oh no . And Temple of the Moon .  That's that one . Hah . Oh no . Ha . Ok . I'm a curse it's me . And that's not . Ok my turn right? . Yeah . Yeah you can . Shore up two right? . I was just gonna go here and I would shore up these two . You can't . Or you move . Why don't you shore up these two yeah . Or shoudl or shoudl these two yeah instead . Wait . So she can shore up two things per turn .  She's right there so . Yeah . So she should shore up that . Those are adjacent . And they can move here . Um . Yeah . Right . Well that might not be the best strategy .  I think you should be getting rid of your two fires and or your two goblets because there's no point in you having . That that's . What should I . Two sets of two . Cause that means you'll either have to discard . You know something from like our collective .  I think you should . Move . Well you have . Three actions right? . Right right so I'm waiting on one more . Right so why don't you move to the . That's what I was gonna say, just move here and whatever card comes . (--) . Move to that spot and get the . Treasure . Beacuse if I get two I'd get six right, so I'd have to get rid of two . Yeah . Depends on what it is, it can be anything . So you just have to get rid of one . Right, one yeah . Oh yeah . So . Yeha but if you gave . So I can give you cards at any time in the game so why don't you move to . Mmhmm . Right that . Yeah but you should be giving me cards because I can move anywhere that would make much more sense and then you shoudl be giving you cards to her because she can send them to me . Your spot . And I can move anywhere . Why don't you just move to the spot and give me . But right now it it . Like your . Goblet and I can give it back to you if you every give . You want me to give it . Ok . Get another one or something . We'd have to be in the same place as well so you just told me to give you the gullet . I I don't have to be in the same place as you, not that's my power that I can just give . Ok so just one . Whichever one . you want to do . I would say Coral place just cause . You can just stay there until you get another fire . So ok so you're saying just give you onw .  That's the best option . I think so . ta . Let's just let's just take one . or no . I would think give her two . Oh . I don't think I can give two yet . She can't . That would be two turns . It's one per action . Yeah . Give a single yeah . You have to . Oh you have to . Oh i'm not standing on the same place . Exactly so you would have to move . Ok let me just move here . To her . Right . Ok that's fine . Or I can . No I would just move here . I mean I can follow you I can move two spots on my next turn . Yeah ok . Can you give me two? . Yeah . And then you draw two of these . Ok I'd have to discard one . Right . So . Whispering Garden . Up here . Mmhmm . Iron Gate . Over here . Ok . Yeah we're done .  Ok so your turn . Alright so it's my turn . MMhmm . So I'm just gonna move here, shore this up . And then move here . Ok so we're in the same place . So I can be on the same tile . Ok . Hmm I think you should just . first send those two to me . those two actions . Which ones? . Yeah . And then . I mean it's right here .  I can get down here . Those two . Yeah but we want to free up . your . Like we want yours freed up so we can send them to someone . Should I just . Then I can't be on the same spot as her . to get her cards, you realize that? . I'd have to be on the same thing as her to get her cards a . Yeah . yeah . So if you . Send those two to me .  That's two turns . And I can't shore up anything now . You can use this to shore up something . True . What are we trying to send . Oh wait .  Right? That . Even that card never mindIt has to be on an adjacent space . I mean I would do that one up there but . It doesn't . I mean I have three, you have one right? . Oh yeah . So . If you're on that card I could give them to you on my turn, so that would be fine . Yeah I think she should send these two . Right . Well he can give on his turn, he can give you the last one . Three, four, five . Ok . Yeah . I'd have to . be down there though . But he would have to, he would have to no .  He could just go to your spot . Wait, you don't have to be in the same place as I am to give me cards . I do she doesn't . you . She ok . So . Wait so I would have to be in . I propose that I do what he said . about . um . giving him the two cards or whatever . and then . just moving one spot . two . yeah . there . anywhere . wherever and . just closer to you . and then . on his next turn he should move to the same spot you're in . And give you that last fourth card . He would have to move here we'd have to . And then on your turn you should move here . ok . Ok . So on your next turn you should move here and then give her your last card and then she can move and get one . yeah . Ok . So this is two actions . One more . Um . This one . And is everybody ok if I use this to shore up? . Mmhmm . Whispering Garden or . Um no . You're gonna wait . Or you wanna stay there? Ok . For later . We should . Yeah we can just wait for later for that . Ok . Wait is there another . Um Lion one somewhere? . Lion . You're on it . So it's unecessary .  Whispering Garden doesn't matter . Yeah . Right . So . I'm gonna draw my two cards . You could . Oh yeah you could have shored . Water Rise's . We should save it for when we need it . And they're dissapearing . So on your turn you move to where she is . Give her . One of those and then do whatever for your third turn . Ok so I'll shuffle that up . Oh yeah . One two . Three . Iron Gate . Is gone . Breaker's Bridge . is . sunk .  It's the one that I'm on . oh . And Lost Lagoon is gone . Lost Lagoon . Ok . Ok . Your turn . Yes . Yeah so . Move one, give one . right . So move up here .  give me the . No he should move here . Alright . he . which color are you? . Oh yeah you'd have to go . red . So you'd have to just use two and then just give me the one . Oh ok . Nope . Just one because it's his power to travel . I can travel . Oh ok . So that's one . And then give her this . And then give you this . Then you have to . And unshore this or whatever . one, two, three, four, you have to discard one . More than five . Nope that's five . You have only five cards . One, two, three, four five six . Oh yeah discard . Oh six oh ok . Just discard one of the fires . So then you need a third turn or you can just draw two . Yeah . Thanks . Ok draw two . Ok . Ok so . Ok . And you draw . Three more . One two . Three . Good by Whispering Garden definitely . Not red . Oh here . Yeah . Ah Temple of the sun . And . And put them . Ok so . Ok . Ok . So . your go . Wait . So you move one first . What's wrong . One, two, three, four, five, six . You have more than five .  Get rid of one of these . ta oh . Or a Sandbag, I guess it doens't matter . I would say sand . No because my special power is already moving then having two Helicopter Lifts, well . Yes, get rid of the Sandbag . Yeha get rid of the Sandbag . She already has one anyways . Cause if you have to move both of us . Ok . And I need oh yeah I already did the one I think ok go ahead . Yeah . Yeah . Ok so give me oh here it is . why is this . you could just move that . Oh to . yeah . somewhere else . Ok . doesnt' matter . Um there you go . so that was one . so then you have . two more things that you can do . you never moved here . Oh ok yeah, so move there so two um . oh . This one, that's two moves . I don't . you want to shore up that? . Nope, can't do that . Oh yeah . Why not, why not? . Beacuse you can't that's too many . That's two more moves . So . Oh yeah . So I don't . I can . Yeah no I can to . I guess . You should try to move closer to the space where she's gotten to be . to exchange cards . so . what's the next treasure? . So move back here . I have three of these .  What do you have? . I don't I just have . Fire . (--) . whatever . Ok . move back here then . Ok . And then it's my turn . Yeah . Um right . Wait no I have to get two cards . Yeah . As well as three of these . Oh yeah . Ok . Ok . Right? . Yeah three . So three, one, two, three ok . Yeah . Tidal Palace . Copper Gate . And Crimson Forest . Yeah I got it . Ok . Ok so my go I'm shore this . Cause I'm right next to it . Ok . Ok . So that's one . Mmm . um . No treasures or anything so just . No . I'm on the same one as you . Yeah . Yeah . Ah . (--) . One so that's it? . And . You . Ok wait let's just ok yeah . And you (--) so pick two . We just have to make sure there's at least one for each of these that's not flooded ok . Right . MMhmm . oh Water Rises sorry guys . (--) . yeah . I realized I was shoveling them while looking at them which is an ineffective practice . Shovel the whole deck . Wait what . You can't do that (--) no . No . Copper Gate . It's always Copper Gate . It's gone . Oh yeah . ok . I'll take the card . Temple of . the Moon . Copper Gate . Crimson Forest is gone . Ok . Ok . Ah this one yeah . Ok . Ok . (--) . So . So it's your go, so can we try to keep Temple of the Moon? . Just because it's so close to where we all are . And Temple of the Sun yeah . One of the two . One of those . And it's right at the top one of them . This one's going to be on the top so . Yeah . Look in those few cards that I shuffled . Hmm . Ok then I guess we should probably keep this one since it's . If you want . Yeah closer to the Fools Landing . Alright . So I guess . Oh no wait, I can't go anywhere . Don't move from that place, yeah stay at your place . Yeah . Why can't he go anywhere? . Because . She said give that to me . We have to get this treasure but wait don't we have to have . To like beyond this one . Why don't you fly there, shore it and fly back .  That's three actions . Yeah um . Blue right . So one, two , three ok . And don't we also have to be on the Lion's head or whatever? . ta yeah . Oh . Only once per turn so I'm just going to stay here . So . Oh you're just gonna stay there . Well here, here .  Why don't you move here . I think so . Oh yeah I'm unshore that sure . because that's just one and shore . and then move back . cause you're not flying your just moving one . MMhmm . Does that work for you? Ok . Yeah that's three yeah . So then it's your turn . Did you pick two cards? . Oh no . As well as three flood cards . So discard that, have this and . What is that? . What was that? Is that Earth? . Awesome . Another Helicopter Lift .  So I got a Helicopter Lift in this thing . Oh we haven't done an Earth yet so you should probably keep the Earth . Yeah . Wait what are we (--) no because we're going after fire so we should definitely disregard this . Oh ok .  Cause we only need three . Ok . Um so one, two three for you . Three . Ok . Tidal Palace gone . Temple of the Sun, gone and then . Breaker's bridge . Ok . Ok . So I'm gonna give you this . Ok . That's one action . That's one .  Wait so also to get that treasure don't you have to be on the same card as that? . Yup . Alright . Alright so you just move to that . Ok . So why don't you shore . What's . Breaker's Bridge . There in and I think that's it . Yeah . Nothin' else . You ready? . Mm you have to get rid of one . Who has more than five . Ha ah whoops . Yeah that's (--) six oh ok good . One two . Ok . (--) ah . Cool ok . So wait . Oh no that's three actions . Is it? . Yeah so that cou- . Well no, you only used two . What are you talking about? . Capturing a treasure is, one action . Well your turn's over, after you take that you're waiting no matter what . Right so that's what I mean, I'm just waiting yeah . Oh I see ok . um . Ok so one two . Three . Mmm take three . That's perfect . Three . Way better than last time . Yeah . Cave of shadows . If I do say so myself . Oh wow this one . Oh no, we're doomed! . No not yet . Oh I got it . Ok . Ok . Dunes of Deception . Oh no what am I doing? Oh ok . Well no this isn't yeah . The Silver Gate is there . there . ok . Ok hm . So um . She already took two . Of these . yeah two cards . Isn't this oh yeah yeah . yeah treasure . So it's my go then . Ok then . Water . You took the yeah? ok yeah go ahead . Yeah I took two water . Ah three water . So I think I would just . shore that obviously cause we're all standing on it . yup . Mmhmm . Um . Who's the one that would move diagonally? . None of us . Oh we don't, we don't have an Explorer . You can . Nope . No that's the Explorer .  a . I can move anywhere, well yeah technically . No you can move diagonally . Nope . It says it right here that . The Explorer may also shift shore up . Explorer . Oh shore up tiles diagonally . Pilot . So I'm going to . Ok . Take two right? . Umm . There's nothing else to do . Yeah . Yeah . I mean you could . Ah no . You should probably just . go there . move . here . Wait you have two more? . But if you guys need a card, oh you don't need a card you already have all four . Yeah you should just move here .

way.So.what do you guys think?.the Sandbag's saves two cards or one card?.that just saves one card but.one card.like anywhere on the island.So I could save one of those two.Don't we have more Lion

two.yeah.Mmhmm..Mmm I dont' need to move..You could..Yeah.Mmm..Unless you move back.It's not really that beneficial.Yeah.I don't think.I'll just move.(--).I flipped those two I think.(--) still

first.Ok so I'm gonna flip.(--) is one.and knock everybody over.Hm.I know you can't, you can't do that one.You can't flip that much, just these two.You can only flip this one, cause it's up and left, not diagonally..Oh.Right.Ok that's right.Um.K one, two.ta, ta.I'm gonna move.because that was one.oh no.two.Um, I'm gonna use the Sandbags to flip that one cause we need the.was that.(--).(--) so that was ok..Two, three.That was the direction I guess.That's what I thought.Ok.Still that being said, I'm still gonna Sandbag this.cause.we kinda need that..(--) didn't have to, I could just move these over and save these two (--).But if I draw the Water's Rise Card.Oh right right that's true.then like potentally which I just did.oh.Ironically.Oh right..Sorry.Did I.Shuffle that first.thanks.Mmm..Do you want to take Crimson Forest off which is right there.And Lost Lagoon as well.And then.Ok.Ok..My turn.Mmhmm..So fly over here so we can flip those two.You um.Mmm yes.You can.So then we (--).Two, wouldn't that be three?.Yeah.(--).And draw two Treasure Cards.And comfortable with the lion.You have to get rid of.And then (--).Um.Ok these.Two then we only have four.No you're one of these.I

to discard one.yeah.oh yeah alright.So (--) be beneficial.Um.Ok.Tidal palace.Ah.Gate.And this one have fun.your turn.Um.You can see if like the.(ends).Ok.I would save just two of those so then you could just give me that.Um stone.Five wait.(--).oh my goodness.right I have.Ooo you can get rid of that blue one.yeah.alright.ok we're good now.and then.Um.I thought you could only do these are you allowed to do the other one.oh you can't do Tidal Palace anyways so just do Cave of Embers.You can go.Either move either one but I think we should save these two.well.I don't.(--) move.She has to move one.Yeah it doesn't have you can't.Yeah yeah she can move but.But she has one of those which I need.and she can only.Oh you just (--) she has you'd have to fly to me to give it to me.Then I can fly to you and give you this but then you're risking losing these.You could flip one.And then fly to me and then give it to me.Ok.Cave of Embers we already have anyway.yeah so I guess flip the Copper Gate.So I'll flip the Copper Gate.So.And then.(--).And change what we did in that.Alright.Sure.Cause it'd be better to do.Tidal Palace since there's already two sun-oh yeah sunk.Though you can't.But then you would do one and then two.You can't because.Well if you fly.So I'll just leave it like that and then I'll fly to you.One.two, three yeah.(--) me two.And then I'm giving you this would be three.Mmhmm..And then one, two, three, four pick two.you can get rid of that.(--).this one.them.oh but there can be.doesn't matter both can be discarded.but either way actually.either one of them.um.because we have the red one and she has all four of those.Oh I'll just start us off.and pick.So it truley.two flood cards.one two three four five.(--) two, three, four, five.oh still (--) role card.two three four five.Oh my goodness, I have more than that.Ok.I was like what is happening here ok.that's fine.we're good.move two flood three.Watchtower.right here.ah Misty Marsh.and Temple of the Sun.That's where I am.So I guess oh yeah.That's ok..(--).well I can save these two.Mmhmm..Well actually.No.Ok.Unflip that.Um.Ok so you need walk here which is one.wait just kidding.I can, I can at least save these two.you can flip them both and then.And then get it.Well that's one, two and the walking there is three.No cause I can save two cards save two (--) Engineer.I can save, I can save two.Oh you can save two?.Oh my goodness ok.yeah.(--).No that's mine.that makes sense.is one two.um ok.Wait were you not?.Aren't you on that one?.So I'm guessing it has to be like.these two.she's right she she started right here.that's like o.Ok.Oh so I can do these two ok..Ok sorry, that's ok, we're we're still learning too.And then two and then.That one and then.three.Ok.So much confusion.Ok.The Water rises one mmhmm.Misty Marsh.That's there so it's gone.and.and then two more.three more.Just two.oh right it's two ok..Cliffs of Abandon.(--).that one.no this one Cliffs of Abandon.Oh yeah that one.and Whispering Garden.that means.that's ok cause I'm gonna get this anyways.Oh ok that's true yeah.So.Ok.Ok.So my turn.And we got that.And then.I'm not gonna do anything.cause I can't.(--).But I forgot that.Ok.Um doesn't matter.Hmm.This is gone.Ok so what you're gonna do.as you're going to fly yourself.wait we have to be on the same tile don't we?.But you can move any player..I think.Well I can play this at any time.Yeah.But I think in orderr for this to work.you can fly yourself.yeah move, more one or more pawns on the same tile.yeah you can move you can fly yourself and others on the same tile or fly others who are on a different tile from you.yeah.So she can fly all three of us.She can.So I can just move myself once.to anywhere.you, hold on, hold she's red.Oh we know that.you're blue.yeah.oh yeah yeah.So.So.you can.well move on or more pawns on the same tile to.you can fly.Any other tile so I can use.wait, wait, you can fly.you, I would fly yourself over here..who says I have to be more pawns on the same tile to any other tile?.yeah.but you don't have to be on that tile here's.So the.Oh shoot.Let me tell you you would fly right here.Mmhmm..and then you would fly.Either me or her to the tile that you're on and then use the Helicopter Lift to fly is here.And since she has a Helicopter Lift then we can all go away.Oh ok so just move here.Mmhmm..and then move?.It doesn't.Just move either of us to the same one using a Helicopter Lift.Just move either of us.And that's getting rid of that.And that uses a Helicopter Lift.And then fly us both to there.Mmhm..Well that uses your other Helicopter Lift.That's the other Helicopter Lift.And then here.And then we just need someone to get this one.Mm still you have to draw two of these.And then draw two there.And then.(--) and lift the second.(--) why now..Does matter and then.Hm.Doesn't matter now.And Flood Cards.three.Tidal Palace.Silver Gate.And Dunes of Deception.I can't find this.Helicopter Lift us out

So she can fly all three of us . She can . So I can just move myself once . to anywhere . you, hold on, hold she's red . Oh we know that . you're blue . yeah . oh yeah yeah . So . So . you can . well move on or more pawns on the same tile to . you can fly . Any other tile so I can use . wait, wait, you can fly . you, I would fly yourself over here . who says I have to be more pawns on the same tile to any other tile? . yeah . but you don't have to be on that tile here's . So the . Oh shoot . Let me tell you you would fly right here . Mmhmm . and then you would fly . Either me or her to the tile that you're on and then use the Helicopter Lift to fly is here . And since she has a Helicopter Lift then we can all go away . Oh ok so just move here . Mmhmm . and then move? . It doesn't . Just move either of us to the same one using a Helicopter Lift . Just move either of us . And that's getting rid of that . And that uses a Helicopter Lift . And then fly us both to there . Mmhm . Well that uses your other Helicopter Lift . That's the other Helicopter Lift . And then here . And then we just need someone to get this one . Mm still you have to draw two of these . And then draw two there . And then . (--) and lift the second . (--) why now . Does matter and then . Hm . Doesn't matter now . And Flood Cards . three . Tidal Palace . Silver Gate . And Dunes of Deception . I can't find this . Helicopter Lift us out and then . Do you have (--) lift .

Hah . ok worked last time . whatever . Not you . Two . Three . Thank you . Water Rise of course . Ah so these go over there . I'm gonna take three . (--) two . Two . Lost Lagoon and Breaker's Bridge . It's out . That . And that one's . What did you get . Ah here . That was it . (--) . that . Ok um . (--) . Ah . Well you can give it to anybody right? . Ah (--) yeah . I always forget . (--) . Two . Temple of the Moon and Cliffs of Abandon . Temple of the Moon . but next time . Right, Right . Ok I'm gonna fly here one . Two . Three . Nice . Two of these . You have two Helicopter Lifts, this . Ok I need two of those suckers . Yup . Golden Gate . Alright . Golden Gate, Phantom Rock . Oh they're both out . Ok um . Does anyone need anything? Ah because nothing needs to be shored up because everything's level and good . Hold on . You give her a moon . Um I can give you yeah . You can get to . Want me to give you this? . You have to get to it first . You have to get to her quick . I'm the blue one . Blue ok so I'll go here . I'll give you this . And um I'm happy where I am so I'll take two of those . Yeah . Thanks . And I guess I get to do some Flood work . Yes . Whispering Garden's here . Iron Gate . Nice . Flipped . Alright, um, I'm, gonna . t,t,t,t,t . Ah . I'll move here first . Then I'll . Crap . Shore this . Yeah . Yeah . Then I'll move . Here . ta . Two of those . (--) . Water's rise . Three . Yup . Breaker's Bridge Whispering Garden, Iron Gate . Iron Gate's out . Breaker's Bridge . Ok . Two . Ok umm . So you . take one . Ok . Take one . Um . Um . So I guess you can't use the Sandbag if the card's here . Yeah that's a little . oh . (--) . (--) . Mmm . Um . So I guess I'll just sh . No I think its . does this, this is the sinking tile that's been drawn . Oh it's sunk . Yeah . Oh good alright then I'll shore this up . Hm . Are you gonna shore this one up instead? . Yeah well I'll use Sandbag for that . Oh ok . Sounds good . That worked . Does that mean, no not really . Nope . Three now . Temple of the Sun, Temple of the Moon . And Cliffs of Abandon . Ok . Go for it . Ah . We'll need . ok . What color are you? . Me? . I'm red . Mmhmm . Yeah (--) . No ok, I want to give you this . Yeah . One of . three . That's one . Shuffle them . Which one . oh . I don't know what do you think? . I don't think . Ok . Maybe this one because . That one for sure yeah . Yeah . Has the little . Treasure Mmhmm . Treasure thing . Yeah . I have one more so I'm thinking of . You have a Helicopter . So you can always fly here and then shore it up . Yeah you can do that too . Is that what everyone votes? . ta . That sounds like a good use yeah . Yeah that sounds fine cause you need to get . Ok . four moons anyway soon . (--) . Oh . Ok . Two of these . And then can you hand me three of those cards? . Yep . (--) . Is it Tidal Palace, Crimson FOrest or Copper Gate? . Tidal Palace . Crimson Forest . Copper Gate . Copper Gate . Alright . Right . Um . I think . You should probably give me that . the blue . We're on the same one . And so I'll get rid of . Yeah . I think that's a good suggestion .  Right? . That's good . I'll get rid of this . Yeah . So that's one . ta ok saw any need in shoring this up? . While I'm on it? . Um . Not really . Hmm . I think this is a (--) . Good . Yeah I agree Tidal Palace . (--) . Wow . So he . If any has to be shored up because we still have Coral Palace . If anything yeah . No . So I guess nothing's really that important but . I can also come here and shore this up, but it's not really essential . yeah I should have two . Oh . We . If I were you I would just try to get here so we can give him that last statue eventually . Can I can give you that . Yeah . So I could move . I can get there . And then next go ahead all around perhaps I can use my magic . Mmm . Whatever . Ok . And do it ok . Yeah . You can shore up Crimson Forest if you want . Sounds good . Just for the heck of it . But I guess that counts as two moves right? So . Yeah once you . And giving her a card was also a move so yeah . Yeah that was two yeah . Oh you gave her a card, I missed that . Yeah . Ok . So . Yeah . Thank you, ok . Two for you . I ch, ch, I wa- . Water's Rise . So Water's Rise sorry ya'll . Oh no . And I get . to throw this one over here yes? . Yes . Ok . One, two, three (--) . Whispering Gardens . Um . Copper Gate, Crimson Forest . Copper Gate is gone .  Crimson Forest is gone . Hmm . Ok . Wha, ch, ch, ch . Um . Oh, oh . You can use that one (--) right the Helicopter Lift . (--) matches on your turn? . I don't know . Oh (--) . Not just on your turn yeah . Ok . Oh so if you want to . Oh wait, now I was a looking at the other one . Oh . I was looking at Sandbags . So you can fly yourself over there . No I think it has to be on your turn right? . You could fly yourself . Yeah . Look at this . I thought the special action cards you could use whenever . At any time not just your turn . The Sandbag is not just your turn . Is that the Helicopter to? . So not just your turn? Ok . Yeah . So I think . If you flew . to me . I could give you this . And then I can get the treasure . Still get to here . name$$$ . Ok . Ok so . (clears throat) So that was one action, so I'm gonna give you this as one action . Ok . Umm . ta . And then . I can get there but . Shore up alright . You can go either direction . You just won't be able to do it yet . I'll just . One and then . Yeah . Two . Ok . Yeah . We don't have any helicopter cards right now just in case it could be a problem . Yeah . Good observation . Ah my turn . Oh we have to . Hm . Do the cards I mean . Oh you didn't take it . Ok (--) too . Helicopter . Ah get rid of this . There you go . Yup . Then three . Three of those . Tidal Palace . Temple of the Sun . And Temple of the Moon . Okay . Um . Did you flip this one over or was it already flipped? . No I flipped that . We just flipped it .  Yeah . Oh ok . ta . Yeah . Where are you right now? . I'm here . Should . (--) you see you need to get to a Moon (--) oh that's what you're ok . Should we worry that I'm on something that's sinking . ah and I want to collect that treasure? Yeah . Yes . Yeah we should worry so I'll use that for that . Yeah .  Um . First I'll give you this so you have to discard one . Ok . Ok . One . Um . Yeah .  I should get rid of that (--) . Yeah . Ah . Um I use a Sandbag . And shore this up . thank you for saving me . yeah . Eh . So you still only used one action right? . So appreciative . So I have, I have two more . Um . Who has the (--) . Probably shore that up . So I'll shore this up . And then . ch,ch,ch . Are your (--) . Maybe (--) get that . Yeah . Oh . Oh that's nice . Hmm . Ok . ohh .  . (--) . (clears throat) . Breaker's Bridge,Cliffs of Abandon, Silver Gate . Silver Gate . Surrounding me . Ok . Yeah right . Ok . Um . Well . Ok, so let's get here . And then next turn you can give me that . Well then . You can also give him . Your fire . Yeah that's what I was looking at . Yeah . Ok so that's two turns . Oo . Good, we got good distribution of treasure . I think I would shore up . Hmm . this . shore this one up? . Or one of these two, just so we can get back .  you know what I mean? . How about Cliffs? . I guess . cause if it does happen to sink . Let's do this one .  Ok . No . That's it for me . And I have to get rid of one of my cards .  Ha ha .  Let's just get rid of this . Oh so you don't even need that anywhere . Alright so . Hmm . Ok . And then can you give me three of those? . Yeah . Hmm . (--) . So Bronze Gate . Cave of Shadows .  Dunes of Deception . Cave of Shadows . Ok Cave of Shadows . Dunes of Deception . Bronze Gate . That's good . Alright . Ok . Alright . Ok .  So I will use my Lions to collect the Lion . Do, do , do, do! . Ta . Yeah! Alright .  And um . ta . One . This is start coming but (--) . I can . Does anybody want this? No, I we really don't need anything with that .  I can move this and shore this u . No . Yeah (--) . That's fine yeah . Yeah . No . Um .  Just in case we need it .  Go ahead . (--) . Yeah no then probably . Ah . Just start getting back to Fool's Landing . this . Ah that's true . Ok . We captured, moved it and shored .  That's all three . So you can use one more . No what? . He is here .  he's . Yeah that's that's all I can do yeah for now so, yeah . Oh ok . Yeah . Oh right .  Right . Ok . Then I'll start making my way over there . Three . ta . Ah Cave of Embers .  Howling Garden .  Misty Marsh . Misty Marsh . I don't see anything . Cave of Embers . Yeah . Ok . Ah we can use some Sandbags I think . Yeah . Ah ok . My turn . Yeah . Um I'm gonna get . So where are you right now? . I'm here . She's gray . I think you need to . And I'm gray . No I'm red sorry . You're red? Ok . Oh so I could just get here . Ok . I think you definitely need to save one of these . Oh or she can capture the . Just in case . Um . Oh man this is tough . So . Yeah . We don't have an Sandbags do we? . No . I have a Helicopter Lift . Oh we'll be good anyway cause you can capture Temple of the Moon . That's true .  Ok . Yeah so don't worry about these guys . Alright . So . That's you just capture it now . Ok so I'll go here . Like this . Yeah that's good . This is two . And then shore up . I can . I would just . Fly to, but unless they want to save it . I would save it cause we're almost done . Yeah . Yeah . Ok .  Um . I'll just . You do whatever . Hit on home . Shore this up but or should I have . I think you should just go home . Ok .  I'll go here .  Alright . Just head on home .  yeah . Get on out of here . Yeah . Don't risk it right? . Yeah . Yeah . Ok three of these . Alright for me I oh just kidding . Oh wait we need to .  I still needed two treasure . Oh you still need treasure? . Ok two treasure . Ohhh . Oh Water's Rise . Hmm . Ok I did Helicopter lift so . Ok . Oh that goes there . No thats' good . Ok . You can move that up one . Yeah . We've got plenty of time . One, two, three . Yeah . That's good . Silver Gate .  Cliffs of Abandon .  Breaking Bridge . We did better than last time . Breaker's Bridge . Silver Gate . What was the other one? . Abandon . Cliffs of Abandon . t,t,t . Oh that's fine . Alright . Yeah my turn . So I'll do one, two, and capture . Yeah . Good work . Yeah we did good . Alright .  Just gotta get home . Alright I'm going to I can only fly myself . I got the flood first . Oh yeah . Um Bronze Gate, Cave of Embers, Temple of the moon . Bronze, Bronze Gate's out . Cave of Embers is out . That's nice I'll swim to . Fool's Landing . Ok . Mmm . Um . Ah Temple of the Moon is out . No I think . did you just flip that?

You have to save green somehow . Oh yeah we have to claim this first .  Right, no we didn't have three . Cause we already have three? . Um . I would . Make sure green survives . Yeah I would make sure, I would shore this two up . That's important . Thank you . Yeah . Keep something near him alive . Ok let's hore that one .  First move . Well you can go diagonal right? . Alright move, move move here . Ah . I can't go diagonal . No no he can go diangonal .  So this is shored up .  he's good . Oh he can't yeah . Mmhmm . I'm good .  As long as my Silver Lake doesn't .

Um . What do we think? . Yup . Do you want to do the same thing first? . Same thing . Same thing or I don't know anything . something new? . Probably something new . Alright . Mmm . Um . No . Because last time we went to Whispering Garden .  Wait no . No we did that two and then we went to Whispering Garden and did that two . Yeah we did . Yeah yeah yeah we did that too . Oh that was a pretty . MMm .  Yeah that was a pretty good one . pretty . pretty tempting offer . It's up to you though . Oh see I already have two fires . Alright, I forgot to look at that . and . so . I mean in three moves it's not really gonna get you . oh . or is it the closest, oh the closest fires's right here and then went there . There's a fire here . That would be different . Yeah but you, I don't think you would have to be, yeah one, two three . They'd both take four moves . Yeah . So I can't go this way? . You could . there you go . But it's one, two, three four or . one, two, three, four .  It's the same thing . Wait, I can't go this way and then down? . Yeah that'd still be one . Yeah, but that's one, two, three . Well I mean it's the same yeah . Either way you're gonna have to take four moves to get them . Mmhmm . This, if I go to do that, I shore up two tiles . That's one move . Oh shore up . On are you talking about shoring up? . Are you talking about shoring up? . Yeah . Yeah if you want to do that, you would have to go here and then shore up these two tiles . Mmhmm . And that would be two moves, two actions and then you could . You would only end up on Cliffs of Abandon . or . Breaker's Bridge . if you did that . Mmhmm . So you can move, you can move here, and then do shore these two up and then you could . So yeah I mean yeah . If that's what you want to do, go for it . Either move here or shore . That one . It's your choice . What do you think? . I'll (--) stay that I'll move . to these . Ok and then you'll shore that? . I said I'm here . Mmmhmm .  now you have one more move . Mmhmm . I have one more move . You can either move here or . anywhere or you can shore this up . Shore up . Oh now you can't move there because if you shore this up that's three . Oh I can't move . Yeah . I'd have to move the water up . and then . no you don't have to, oh you do, I didn't see that . Mmhm . (damn party) . (--) . That's that one . THis is Water rise . This is the water .  Oh it's right here . Ok . That and two of these . Ok so Cities of Abandon .  Or cliffs, I keep saying cities . Yeah . And then . Lost Lagoon . Oh wow . So that's gone . Yeah . Now where did this go? . Look over there yeah . Ok . Alright so ah . Where am I at? I'm gonna move there . Go . (--) go to Temple of Doom again . that's the one I have . Oh right . I can go Misty Marsh . Shore up Cliffs and then go to Temple of Doom . Yeah that . You know we're, I mean . oh yeah Cliffs, yeah . Or I can give her this . I can give her this card . Go to Misty marsh . And then shore up the Cliffs of Abandon and that way she has . both and on her way she can . But then I have to get rid of something don't I? . What (--) there? . Yeah . that . No you only have four . No you only have four . Oh ok .  That's right . Oh you want to do that? Ok . Wait oh yeah I keep forgetting you're the Messenger so I'm like (--) . Alright yeah that's fine and then two . Oh perfect, perfect . Which ones? . Gold Gate and Phantom Rock . Phanthom Rock oh (--) . and can I have the Phanthom Rock over there? . Gold Gate . And then (--) . Which? Which Gold Gate? . Right there . Ahhh . Oh . Devastating . Well at least we don't have any sunken . Yeah . Oh now it's my turn, alright .  Um . ta . I mean we don't have any . (--) dying . You used . just move to . move towards the Howling Gardens . Howling or Whispering? Oh Howling Gardens? . Hey . Only two moves . I could be . and then but we are all closer up there yeah . You could just go to Whispering . Yeah . Yeah and then I'll . Well you're closer to Fool's Landing . Yeah but we'll oh wait, I dont' know . Do you want to risk the Helicopter? . Fiasco that almost happened . That's it . But even if I was here I don't, we would, we would yeah . Yeah we would still have to yeah, you're right . So um . You don't have to use all three actions right? . No . Ok so I'll just move here as one and then . Yup . No I'll just yeah . Oh, another Helicopter . And I can also give her this . Whispering Gardens . And then um . Breaker's Bridge . Yeah . Ok . You're up . You're gonna shore those up immediately if you want . Well . Um . Hm . Is there trading? Can we trade? . (--) . No I don't think so . Oh ok . You can shore them up and then just go to Coral Palace . Shore what up? . Through the one that you're on and the one next to you . The one adjacent to you? . Just one move . Yeah . And then just go to Coral Palace . Which palace? Oh Coral palace, right, right right . So then I'll have to pick up some cards? . and then now yeah you have to pick up two cards . (--) . Um . Ok so I want to get rid of this one . Oh . Yeah . Mmhmm . Yeah right now . And which one is it? . Ok .  Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate . Ok . So you can . (--) . I might as well move on it . Yeah that's . Two . And then yeah I don't . Alright where? . Yeah . Because everything is yeah . Oh (well) . Now you have to ris some water . You got three . Dropping it . Oh yeah . Yeah we got off that yeah . Every time . This is the worst part too cause you just knows something's gonna . Yeah . Right .  Right . ta Iron Gate's done . Oh man . Luckily we . at least it's that ah . Flip that . Temple oh right . Oh yeah put that over there . And what was the other one? . And a Tidal Palace? . Oh . (--) . (--) . Yeah . Oh Whispering Garden .  Sorry . And they both had that . Yup . Water . Yeah . Yeah what I was thinking . was . shore this up . Mmhmm . Um I fly using my thing to her . Give her this fire . And then I'll have four . We can go . And then you can, on your next turn you can go here and get . Yeha, yeah, yeah . Yeah yeah, well you'll be done at that point . Yeah . Yup . So . Good call . Up for this up and then I'll fly over here . Mmhmm . Um you're gonna have to get rid of your um . Fire . Chalice . One of your chalice . (--) . Then I'll move . Oh not yet, not yet, not yet, yet . Well he's not done yet . Oh it's not my turn? . And then yeah until I do this stuff . Oh I got Sandbags . I have this too so I can give that to you . Ok .  Howling Garden . Down . Breaker's Bridge . And then Cities . of Abandon, Cliffs of Abando .  Ohh . Alright . Before she does anything . should we sandbag . Temple of the Moon? . Right . Before she . possible . Oh yeah we can I 'll use mine . Yeah ok . Yeah .  yeah . Yeah that's fine . And then . That's there . So that's we don't have to render that problem . MMhmm . And then on your turn you . Oh so it;s your turn .  You can actually shore these up . Shore those up . Move down . Move here and then take it . You know what I'm saying?So you don't . You um . Shore these two up . Mmm . Move . So we don't have to worry about them . Mmhmm . you move down . And then you can get the Treasure . Mmhmm . And that's like, I think that's the most efficient one . And then you would have to yeah . (--) that . Thank you . (--) . There we go . Mm . ta . I could . If I oh wait . Um . It's too late now . Wait . No, no no I'm just saying thinkin' ahead . I can move . down here . (--) . Go ahead . And then um Helicopter Lift all the way up to here and then we can both give you, I should . Ah I don't know . (--) that . I mean I bet we could . Yeah . Well we could think about that for a second . Yeah what was the? . Well can't he do his turn? . Oh it's . Crimson Forest . Crimson Forest . Copper Gate . Copper Gate ok . And Cave of Embers . Oh Cave of Embers . Cave . So . I don't want to give these up, I want to, should I give you this? . Yeah . Yeah might as well . So you're the only . Wait, wait, wait wait, yeah before you do that . Wait that, that's (--) before you do that . You're the only one that can give cards away . No if you're on the same tile as someone you can give them away . But he he he's the only one anywhere .  Yeah . Oh . But I can give them out anytime . and you guys have to be on the same tile . Mmhmm . Alright so . I can't get off that spot .  I'm staying there . Right? . Yeah I mean . Well can you do that? . ah sure . Ah shore up . Can you just stay there? . Yeah you don't have to take any moves . I could shore up . Or you could . I mean you could just shore up go down here, shore up I mean cause I don't think . You're gonna be . One two three . Four . Wait one . two three? . But then I wouldn't I wouldn't be on . You'd be, you'd be on Misty, yeah . Temple of the Moon anymore . And it's not like we really care about Copper Gate . (--) Copper Gate . Yeah but do you . But I mean do we need, do you need to on . What was the other, I mean the other one's down here . Temple of the Moon? . That's true . I know You can still, as long as you can still stay around the same area it doesn't . So once you (--) . Yeah and you can also helicopter down to Temple of the Sun if you want . For some reason . You're right .  I don't think we need to do that um . So I don't have any moves . Yeah just shore this up . Which one? . (--) Crismon Forest, might as well . Ok . There you go and then . Hmmm . I don't want to move anywhere . Mmhmm . Hmm . Oh . Fortunate . What's your plan? . Mmhm . Oh yeah  . Oh I forgot about this . Oh .  Well we got Whispering still . Yeah then if this goes we definitely need it . Shh well it's gone so . Copper Gate's also gone . Oh wow . That's also a heartbreaker . Oh man . What chalices do we got, where we got chalices at? . So I could fly over to you and give this . Yeah you fly to me and give me that . And then . Or . You could move to her . Heli-oh . That was was I was saying .  I was like I should Helicopter . But then she wouldn't be anywhere close to a . Oh we already got the fire so that doesn't matter . Yeah yeah it doesn't matter about the fire . And then it would be two moves . So like I say one and then . This is free . yeah . and then I give you that . two . and then I don't know what I would do and we kinda need . move . this slides . I can Sandbag that right now . or it . Actually we might not even need that live we might need . this, like these two alive because we have um . she has two of those too . but we have the fire . yeah we have the fire but um I only have one of this and sh .  . Well we, so we would only need the Chalice alive if I get . Mmhmm . the rock . Mmhmm . So we really don't need to worry about that . Yeah . But . Yeah it's still nice just in case like if we get two of these then it would be . Yeah . (--) . so do we Sandbag it or not? . Ah yeah yeah we should burn it . Burn it? . So you want to go pick her up? . Yeah I'll pick her up and then we'll go here . That's one . Two . Oh that's free yeah . No that's free . And then um, two . two? . And then I could start moving somewhere . Oh . Did I oh I didn't fly yet so I could fly . Hmmf . Um . Hmm . I could fly and like um . Oh we don't need this . Just do it . I could just like land here . Just go to Whispering Garden .  Yeah might as well . Yeah Whispering Garden . Yeah . Sounds cool . Whispering . Well now Helicopter Lift . (--) . and I got this too . No so now . um Breaker's Bridge . Crimson Forest . Crimson Forest . Cities of Abandon . Cliffs . Oh why, alright yeah, yeah see . It looks like cities . Oh wow . Yeah I know um yeah . Well now can I give this to you? Since we're on the same tile? . Yes you can . Oh yeah, yeah that's oh you might have, wait one, two, three four five . Oh yeah get rid of . Mmhmm get rid of . fire, screw the fire . Yeah screw the fire . Yup . So then you can . Either . Move . Are you at the Crimson Forest? . Yeah this is unimportant . Yeah I owuld move and then . to Misty Marsh Maybe? . Shore up? . Yeah yeah move to Misty Marsh and then shore up Cliffs of Abandon . Yeah . That's the only thin you can do unless you want to move to . Yeah some . Oh look . Oh . What? . Oh my God . Wow . Alright, so . Cave of Embers . Oh this is (--) can I have that? . Cave of Embers (--)yeah thank you . Mmhmm . Temple of the Moon . (--) . Temple of the Moon . Oh (--) . yeah ok . Oh ou may need that . And then the Silver Gate . Ok . Let's put those right there . Mhmm . yeah . Go ahead and do that . That's one . One . You should, mayeb just move together . So maybe just stay here . I could or I could um . go here . For what? What do we need? . (--) over here so so . can you just . She needs to get . there . What you could do is, you do this, move here I can helicopter you guys to here . And then . but it would still have to be her turn . And then on . but then we'd be all together . and then on my turn, I'd just Helicopter . over here? . but we need to get on Fool's Landing . Oh right . why don't you just Helicopter us to Fool's Landing and she . uses her turn to . oh that could be, well you would have to move there . yeah I mean then . ok . that's two . and then just Helicopter us . ok . I'll Helicopter both of you gusy over here . and then I'll be you can just end your turn right there . Oh why? . would you do that? why can't . I move here? . Mmhmm . Well . because it's his turn right now . I mean eventually well why couldn't I move here . Mmhmm . And then . Mm (--) I could have moved there . I think that . because I'd be stuck up there still . I think the best choice is because on your trun you can go here that's one . then you take that, that's two and then you go back to Fool's Landing . Oh ok . Yeah we're out of here yeah . Ah huh .  alright . cause ah I think that's the best choice . Mmhmm . Alright so you're at (--) . Oh we had to do that yeah . ta . Ah Bronze Gate . that creepy house thing . Coral Palce . Got it . Oh (--0 . Oh . I can I can do that actually . And Dunes of Deception . Alright so um I'll go here for . shore it up . yeah . and then just move here . so that's one, two three yeah . That's all you need to do .  Yeah, yeah do it . That's one . Two . Yeah . then three . Ah yeah that's five . Ah Misty Marsh . Ah sorry (--) . Temple of the Sun . And Tidal Palace . (good) . So just . move, collect . move back . and then collect that . discard that . move back . Oh sorry I'll do that . Mmhmm . Um and can we just leave right now? .

Team2601.csv,"Ok so it doesnt' look like any of us have the same cards..And looks like these are switched, these places..Yeah so.So I think it's like I guess we gotta determine like the importance of which area we definitely want to always save and which ones we don't care that much..Um..Yeah it seems like working in the bottom half of the map worked for us..It's.And it's interesting how like the Flood, the Flood cards worked in that.What would happen is that we would - if you get the Flood increased the Flood Waters it would consistently just be the same.Yeah exactlty.tiles over and over again flooded so we have to keep that in mind..Hmm..So I think I could probably do the same thing I did last time to start.Mhm..Might as well and then go here and then get two more..And then.I get two cards..Water's Rise.Water's Rise so (--) over there move this up one..So.I'll take these..Shuffle.on the top.two..And I'll get that..Yup..Gold Gate and Temple of the moon..So Gold Gate is sunk..Hmm..Okay..Temple of the Moon is what you're on right now..Ok great..Alright, you're up..Alright so I'm up so I don't..Have to give you guys really anything as of right now. Don't have to worry about that..Um..Yeah..So what I can do is I can.Ah just shore up and then move twice over here as I cover this area..Do you want me to give you.this.on my next turn?.You can only.On your next turn? um.I dont' s.Or do you think we should wait and see (--).We'll wait to see like who has more cards of it I think cause I can always give you this card at any time so.Ok alright, that sounds good.Yeah true, that sounds good to me..Ok so I'll shore this up..alright..And then I'll move two over here.

Ok..So Whispering Garden's gone..Iron Gate's gone..Hmm..Breaker's Bridge is flooded..Hmm..Ok..Alright..Ok..Keep in mind you have two Helicopter Lifts so you can take us anywhere or one of us anywhere and I have a Sandbag's so you can save one..Ok.Alright, you're turn.So I think you should give me the Chalice first..I'm thinking..Ok yeah..And then.Which one are you gonna discard?.We have three of these, so I feel like we should get rid of fire..Oh ok, yeah, yeah that's a fair one..Right, yeah..Um so you can get rid of that and then you have two moves left so I think you should shore up..So,.Oh.Breaker's Bridge probably.Yeah might as well..Ok.And then.If you want you can.I could get closer to you so you could give me that..Well you so I can give you this any time, you don't have to be with me cause I'm the Messenger, so I would suggest.Oh right..Just staying there maybe so that way he can give me.Getting closer to there..Yeah you and I being together probably..Well.I think I need to stay with you so you can give me the purple and then I could just fly over whenever to do that..Yeah true. Smart..That's true yeah..Yeah that's smart..So you can so he;s gonna be moving here. So I mean it's irrelevant if you want to move here hemoves there and gives you.Yeah..Alright..That sounds good to me..Oh ok then yeah I'll move here..Ok alright. Let me get two treastures..hmm..Hmm..Then you gotta discard um.Oh no you don't do you?.Mmm. I thinkI'm good right now..You have five right?.Ok I didn't we'll stick that one in.Alright, perfect..And then um.three flood cards.three.yup.so Lost Lagoon.Cliffs of Abandon.(--)..And,.Temple of the Moon.The moon?.Oh right there..There, ok sorry..So those three are flooded, ok..Yeah..Ok..Ok so.Normally, I'd want to get both of those but I can't really.Oh Temple of the Moon we don't have to worry about cause we have Temple of the Sun over here..Just (--).Yeah true..That's closer to Fool's Landing so it's more convenient..mmhmm..Shore up.Ok so I can just move.Give her.the statue.right? and then.I can capture the treasure.Trade in.Right?.Yeah..cause you can give her the statue.and then I would.(--).I would recommend that you use one of your cards first..Ok..Um since you'll have to discard one anyway so you might as well just.Um.Use it..What you could do is,.Well I could fly you over to here..Or.inversely well.cause then I could give you this and ah well what were you gonna say?.Yeah true, I would say flying him.Closer to the.Over there is the best strategy cause.Howling Garden..Saves you time in terms of movements..True yeah..Yeah do dhtat, do you want to fly me over? Ok..Alright, you want me to just, yeah I'll just fly you right over..Ok, and then use one of your Helicopter Lifts..Yeah.So I keep one for when I get off the island..And then.You.Um.Wait is it still my turn?.Then you're gonna move.That's it's my turn..Oh it's.Oh yeah sorry ok yeah. I got the.Oh yeah..Yeah so ah, I'll move right?.Mmhmm..I'll give you this and then for my third I'll capture.Ok..The chalice.Nice.Good deal.Alright cool.And then I get two treasure cards.Good we got the fourth one of this which is good..and three.Nice.And three floods, so we have Temple of the Sun.Ah Crimson Forest.(--).Ok and the Copper Gate..(--) blew it. Ok so the three are flooded..Pretty.Yeah.Ok so.Right so my turn now, so I can um.So you have one, you have one. So.You can just give me.your purple thing whenever.Right?.Right I can give you it and then you can discard one of yours.Which you would have to discard a Sangbag Card for and a Helicopter Lift..Um or.Oh yeah then maybe I'll use this.What do you want to use it for?.I think you should use the Sandbag.This..For that? Ok..Yeah definitely.Alright so you're shoring up that..And then I can give you.This right?.Mmhmm..You have to move.I don't have to I'm Messenger.Oh yeah true.Yeah. Good..So.I'll do that um I'll stay here and I think that'll be my turn. Is that cool with everyone..Mmhm..Take..Two of these which was discarded..Ah Water' Rise, so I have a Chalice..So..That's fine and then so I have to mix these up..That's uh three now still. Ok..That down..To three..So it's gonna be Temple of the Sun again..Um Crimson Forest..And Copper Gate, so both of those are now sunk.Mm. Good..Yeah..Ok..Alright, we're good..Ok so I guess first um if you want to discard that and I can give you this.You have to.Move.Move to be with him.Yeah so you have to be on mine..Ok..So I'll discard this and give you that. Alright..Do you have three of those?.I have just three?.And then um.So if I move there..You can fly anywhere now, you can go, so you can use your special ability so you can.I think you should.Stay.Mm.yeah I think you should stay where you are just cause.in case I get.Ah.Um.She could draw it right now like the next time so if you were just to move here and shore it up.True, yeah that's true..Can I just do that one turn?.Yeah true, plus you can fly everywhere.Mmmhmm, cause you just, well what'd you do?.Well no you moved in gave.Well, you'd oh no so you 'd have one more turn ok..Yeah..You might as well--.I can do Sandbag on Temple of the Sun in case you guys were worried.I think maybe we should just because it's in the discard pile so if we get Water's up.Well.I think it's also unlikely we get it though do you ? I don't know..Cause it's only three cards, and we only have seen it once right? Cause we just used it..So unless we get another Water's Rise..(--).Um I mean I can just use a Sandbag, (--) I mean there's really no.Do we have to use the Sandbag before we see the card? Or can we use it if we see a card we can Sandbag and then it happens again?.Do you see the card?.Pretty sure you can't save it..Does it say we can use it whenever?.Pretty sure it's sunk..It says,it says you can play at any time but I think the order would.it would make more sense and be more difficult if it was like you see the card and then you can't use the Sandbag because.Sure.I don't know that's just my take on it..Yeah I think we should do that and Sandbag because I can.Yeah I think we need to unshore that.I can uh.save both of these, like I stay right here and save both of them with my ability if you didn't want to flip.Ok so (--).So I think you should Sandbag Temple of the Sun.So Sandbag Temple of the Sun.Ok so I'll Sandbag that..Alright..And then um you have.One more.Yeah you have one more move and then I think you should fly there..action.as you last one yeah and then I think you're done yeah..Ok..Um yeah..And you get two cards..Ok..Thanks.Yeah! Ok..Alright so that's three, next ok. So you have three..It's nice to get a Helicopter Lift.Oh wait I need to get rid of one..Yeah.Yeah.So you can (--) a Helicopter Lift. Ok so.Yeah..take three floods..So you have Temple of the Moon.which is now sunk..Ah Cliffs of Abandon's also sunk..And.Breaker's Bridge is the only one that's flooded. So these two..Mmhmm..(--).So now we really have to.hope..Ok. Alright so.your turn..Ok we can start getting the fire too..So.you, I would recommend you move to me. Trade me your.Yeah..The gold one. That would be two actions..Then I think I should move back one cause you can give that to me wherever so it doesn't matter if I'm near you ..Yup..Ok..um and that's my three so then I get two cards..Ok..Well that was nice..That's next..Ah three..Ah yeah..Ok so we have a Silver Gate..Tidal Palace and Lost Lagoon. So Lost Lagoon is sunk..Alright so mine, I will.take.um.That.capture a treasure is one..Capture a treasure. Are we capturing any of the other treasures?.Ah yeah we got the chalice and then you should give me the fire..Mmm..Ok so we have.Ok and then I'll.Yeah I'll give you the fire..And then, I will start.And then there's no need to stay there. Yeah..I guess I'll start moving, I'll move one this way.Ok.Yeah now we have the cards for your guys. You shoudl just go towards Fools' Landing..Ok..Yup. So I got these two. Draw three..So we have Bronze Gate..Flooded..Ah.Cave of Shadows is flooded..Mm..Ok and then Dunes of Deception is flood..This ok alright, we're good. Now you're turn..Alright so first thing I'm gonna do is put this in..Ok..And then um, I think I should.So we only have three so we could.fly here and shore that up..Yeah..Ok..Just so you have the f-.So we so now all we have to do is get to Fool's Landing..close to you.Well I have to get the fire.We don't have to we have three out of four, you just need three..Out true that's right. We don't even need all four, did we get all four last time?.Oh really?.Yup.We did but I mean.Might as well just go for it..It'll just be a longer time now..Let's see.Um alright so.Alright and then ah.Misty Marsh.and Howling Garden.and Cave of Embers top there..Okay..Ok cool. Is it my turn now?.Alright..Mmhmm..Yeah..Ok so.um I guess I'll just move one..Yeah it doesn't matter. I think you can just capture..I'll get it just cause why not..Yeah why not..Alright and then move..And then move here..and the moving..Ok then you get two..You have a Water's Rise.and Helicopter Lift which is awesome..Yeah..Ok so Water's Rise um..Still three though luckily.That's still three..Alright so Coral Palace.Observatory and Watch.Hmm.tower..Oh.Oh.Now we gotta shuffle.Apologies I forgot to shuffle..Ahh I got too excited cause we're gonna win..Hmm..Alright..Put on top..Ok that's three alright sorry, so Cave of Embers, so that's sunk..three.Yup.Alright.Ah Dunes of Deception, that's sunk and.Cave of Shadows.That is now flooded. Ok..Alright so now it's my turn? Alright..T, yes..Hmm..Ok so I will just move.I can Helicopter Lift you there at no expense..hmm..Ok yeah Helicopter, move done..Yeah then you can Helicopter us out and we're done..Helicopter us out and we're done..Ok..There we go.I got so excited there..Cool ah that was nice..Hmm..Hmm.",s,sd  sd  b  sd  %  sv  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  %  sd  sd  ad  %  sd  b^m  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  qy^d  fc  sd  sd  sv  %  b  sd  sd  qy  ba  sd  %  sd  sd  qy  sd  ba  aa  sd  b  sd  sd  br  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  sv  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  qy  aa  b  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  qw  qw  sd  b  qy  b  sd  sd  %  sd  b  b  sv  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  fc  ba  sd  sd  b  %  sd  ba  sd  b  qw  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  bk  sd  sd  sd  sd  h  sv  %  sd  sd  %  %  sd  qy  sv  aa  b  sd  qy  fc  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  b^m  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  b  b  sd  b  fc  sd  sd  b  %  qw  sd  ba  b  sv  %  b  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  ba  aa  ba  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  qy  sd  qy  sd  ba  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  %  sd  sd  ba  sd  qy  b  b  %  sd  sd  %  aa  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sv  %  %  qw  sd  %  sv  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sv  aa  ad  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  %  qy  sv  sd  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  ba  ba  bk  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  ba  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  qw  sd  ba  sd  aa  sv  sd  b  b  sd  sd  ba  %  sd  b  %  sd  sd  %  sd  qy  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  b  b  fc  sd  %  bf  sd  sd  b  sd  qy  sd  %  sd  sd  sv  fc  sv  sd  b  %  sd  aa  sd  sv  qw  qy^d  sv  b  ad  sd  sv  %  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  qy  sd  qy  sd  sd  sv  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  ad  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  sv  b  b  sd  b  fc  b  sd  sv  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  qy^d  sd  sd  %  sd  b  %  sd  ba  b  ^h  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sv  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  %  %  %  sd  qy  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  bh  b  sd  sv  sd  ^h  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  qy  b  b  b  b  sd  sv  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  b  b,"Ok so it doesnt' look like any of us have the same cards . And looks like these are switched, these places . Yeah so . So I think it's like I guess we gotta determine like the importance of which area we definitely want to always save and which ones we don't care that much . Um . Yeah it seems like working in the bottom half of the map worked for us . It's . And it's interesting how like the Flood, the Flood cards worked in that . What would happen is that we would - if you get the Flood increased the Flood Waters it would consistently just be the same . Yeah exactlty . tiles over and over again flooded so we have to keep that in mind . Hmm . So I think I could probably do the same thing I did last time to start . Mhm . Might as well and then go here and then get two more . And then . I get two cards . Water's Rise . Water's Rise so (--) over there move this up one . So . I'll take these . Shuffle . on the top . two . And I'll get that . Yup . Gold Gate and Temple of the moon . So Gold Gate is sunk . Hmm . Okay . Temple of the Moon is what you're on right now . Ok great . Alright, you're up . Alright so I'm up so I don't . Have to give you guys really anything as of right now .  Don't have to worry about that . Um . Yeah . So what I can do is I can . Ah just shore up and then move twice over here as I cover this area . Do you want me to give you . this . on my next turn? . You can only . On your next turn? um . I dont' s . Or do you think we should wait and see (--) . We'll wait to see like who has more cards of it I think cause I can always give you this card at any time so . Ok alright, that sounds good . Yeah true, that sounds good to me . Ok so I'll shore this up . alright . And then I'll move two over here .  Ok so . Alright let me grab two . Draw two . To have another . (--) a Sandbag . Now I'll draw two . Then . Floods so we have a Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon . Cliffs of Abandon yeah Lost Lagoon . Lost Lagoon's right here . Ok . Ok . Alright um . I mean I guess I could . shore up, I could fly and shore up one of them . Yeah I feel like the end ones don't matter much to us, I feel like . we're . yeah so these two (--) there . I feel like just getting Cliffs of Abandon is the only important thing for us at this point . Ok . So it would be two actions you just took and then . mm . Do you want to move anywhere else or . Mm yeah I think . Mm . Mm . I think we're in a good spot right now . Yeah (--) and draw two cards . Ok so two there . I'll give you two floods . Ok . Ok so I need to . Yeah so Phanthom Rock is gone . Breaker's Bridge and oh . Ok . I need to try and get the chalice from you . Where's Breakers Bridge? . Breaker's Bridge, where is it? . Oh it's right here . Oh ok . Was that you said? . Alright . I said I should try and get the Chalice . You guys (--) there . (--) (her) . Ok so you have two, I have two of these so the importance could be ok . Oh yeah . Ok . So your'e yeah it's your turn . So I guess what I can do is . Um . Move here . Mmhmm . Flip 'em both . And just move over to the Cave of Shadows . So that way she doesn't have to waste a turn moving to you . Ok . Ok for you to trade? Ok, that's fine yeah . Mmm . So move here . Get both of these two, three, two cards . (--) Ok . Didn't . Two cards here then we got a chalice .  That's good . Perfect . Two cards . Hmm . You got Whispering Garden whcih is now . Up here . Yeah up there . And Iron Gate . Iron Gate got it . Cool . Ok cool . Alright, you're up . So for mine I have these two . I need to trade or give you guys any of these yet, you already have five . Um so my . guess I guess . I think we should ignore Whispering Garden and I guess like this area . And cause we . So far there's no flooding that's happening in this area so . I can just move . Um . ta . I don't need to worry about trading with you .  I said there's no point and so I can just move and that's it . Like do you guys want to move anywhere in particular? . I think whereever you are is . I guess . Yeah . pretty fine . You think it's fine? you good? . Stay close . Yeah . Yeah I think that's fine . Alright . I'll take . Two of these . A water's rise . And then I have a . That's one which you have one of them and you have one .  Ok . So now we're up to three, so now you have to shuffle and draw three . Right, ok . So . Shuffle . the top, draw three .  Ok . So Whispering Garden's gone . Iron Gate's gone . Hmm . Breaker's Bridge is flooded . Hmm . Ok . Alright . Ok . Keep in mind you have two Helicopter Lifts so you can take us anywhere or one of us anywhere and I have a Sandbag's so you can save one . Ok . Alright, you're turn . So I think you should give me the Chalice first . I'm thinking . Ok yeah . And then . Which one are you gonna discard? . We have three of these, so I feel like we should get rid of fire . Oh ok, yeah, yeah that's a fair one . Right, yeah . Um so you can get rid of that and then you have two moves left so I think you should shore up . So, . Oh . Breaker's Bridge probably . Yeah might as well . Ok . And then . If you want you can . I could get closer to you so you could give me that . Well you so I can give you this any time, you don't have to be with me cause I'm the Messenger, so I would suggest . Oh right . Just staying there maybe so that way he can give me . Getting closer to there . Yeah you and I being together probably . Well . I think I need to stay with you so you can give me the purple and then I could just fly over whenever to do that . Yeah true .  Smart . That's true yeah . Yeah that's smart . So you can so he;s gonna be moving here .  So I mean it's irrelevant if you want to move here hemoves there and gives you . Yeah . Alright . That sounds good to me . Oh ok then yeah I'll move here . Ok alright .  Let me get two treastures . hmm . Hmm . Then you gotta discard um . Oh no you don't do you? . Mmm .  I thinkI'm good right now . You have five right? . Ok I didn't we'll stick that one in . Alright, perfect . And then um . three flood cards . three . yup . so Lost Lagoon . Cliffs of Abandon . (--) . And, . Temple of the Moon . The moon? . Oh right there . There, ok sorry . So those three are flooded, ok . Yeah . Ok . Ok so . Normally, I'd want to get both of those but I can't really . Oh Temple of the Moon we don't have to worry about cause we have Temple of the Sun over here . Just (--) . Yeah true . That's closer to Fool's Landing so it's more convenient . mmhmm . Shore up . Ok so I can just move . Give her . the statue . right? and then . I can capture the treasure . Trade in . Right? . Yeah . cause you can give her the statue . and then I would . (--) . I would recommend that you use one of your cards first . Ok . Um since you'll have to discard one anyway so you might as well just . Um . Use it . What you could do is, . Well I could fly you over to here . Or . inversely well . cause then I could give you this and ah well what were you gonna say? . Yeah true, I would say flying him . Closer to the . Over there is the best strategy cause . Howling Garden . Saves you time in terms of movements . True yeah . Yeah do dhtat, do you want to fly me over? Ok . Alright, you want me to just, yeah I'll just fly you right over . Ok, and then use one of your Helicopter Lifts . Yeah . So I keep one for when I get off the island . And then . You . Um . Wait is it still my turn? . Then you're gonna move . That's it's my turn . Oh it's . Oh yeah sorry ok yeah .  I got the . Oh yeah . Yeah so ah, I'll move right? . Mmhmm . I'll give you this and then for my third I'll capture . Ok . The chalice . Nice . Good deal . Alright cool . And then I get two treasure cards . Good we got the fourth one of this which is good . and three . Nice . And three floods, so we have Temple of the Sun . Ah Crimson Forest . (--) . Ok and the Copper Gate . (--) blew it .  Ok so the three are flooded . Pretty . Yeah . Ok so . Right so my turn now, so I can um . So you have one, you have one .  So . You can just give me . your purple thing whenever . Right? . Right I can give you it and then you can discard one of yours . Which you would have to discard a Sangbag Card for and a Helicopter Lift . Um or . Oh yeah then maybe I'll use this . What do you want to use it for? . I think you should use the Sandbag . This . For that? Ok . Yeah definitely . Alright so you're shoring up that . And then I can give you . This right? . Mmhmm . You have to move . I don't have to I'm Messenger . Oh yeah true . Yeah .  Good . So . I'll do that um I'll stay here and I think that'll be my turn .  Is that cool with everyone . Mmhm . Take . Two of these which was discarded . Ah Water' Rise, so I have a Chalice . So . That's fine and then so I have to mix these up . That's uh three now still .  Ok . That down . To three . So it's gonna be Temple of the Sun again . Um Crimson Forest . And Copper Gate, so both of those are now sunk . Mm .  Good . Yeah . Ok . Alright, we're good . Ok so I guess first um if you want to discard that and I can give you this . You have to . Move . Move to be with him . Yeah so you have to be on mine . Ok . So I'll discard this and give you that .  Alright . Do you have three of those? . I have just three? . And then um . So if I move there . You can fly anywhere now, you can go, so you can use your special ability so you can . I think you should . Stay . Mm . yeah I think you should stay where you are just cause . in case I get . Ah . Um . She could draw it right now like the next time so if you were just to move here and shore it up . True, yeah that's true . Can I just do that one turn? . Yeah true, plus you can fly everywhere . Mmmhmm, cause you just, well what'd you do? . Well no you moved in gave . Well, you'd oh no so you 'd have one more turn ok . Yeah . You might as well-- . I can do Sandbag on Temple of the Sun in case you guys were worried . I think maybe we should just because it's in the discard pile so if we get Water's up . Well . I think it's also unlikely we get it though do you ? I don't know . Cause it's only three cards, and we only have seen it once right? Cause we just used it . So unless we get another Water's Rise . (--) . Um I mean I can just use a Sandbag, (--) I mean there's really no . Do we have to use the Sandbag before we see the card? Or can we use it if we see a card we can Sandbag and then it happens again? . Do you see the card? . Pretty sure you can't save it . Does it say we can use it whenever? . Pretty sure it's sunk . It says,it says you can play at any time but I think the order would . it would make more sense and be more difficult if it was like you see the card and then you can't use the Sandbag because . Sure . I don't know that's just my take on it . Yeah I think we should do that and Sandbag because I can . Yeah I think we need to unshore that . I can uh . save both of these, like I stay right here and save both of them with my ability if you didn't want to flip . Ok so (--) . So I think you should Sandbag Temple of the Sun . So Sandbag Temple of the Sun . Ok so I'll Sandbag that . Alright . And then um you have . One more . Yeah you have one more move and then I think you should fly there . action . as you last one yeah and then I think you're done yeah . Ok . Um yeah . And you get two cards . Ok . Thanks . Yeah! Ok . Alright so that's three, next ok .  So you have three . It's nice to get a Helicopter Lift . Oh wait I need to get rid of one . Yeah . Yeah . So you can (--) a Helicopter Lift .  Ok so . Yeah . take three floods . So you have Temple of the Moon . which is now sunk . Ah Cliffs of Abandon's also sunk . And . Breaker's Bridge is the only one that's flooded .  So these two . Mmhmm . (--) . So now we really have to . hope . Ok .  Alright so . your turn . Ok we can start getting the fire too . So . you, I would recommend you move to me .  Trade me your . Yeah . The gold one .  That would be two actions . Then I think I should move back one cause you can give that to me wherever so it doesn't matter if I'm near you  . Yup . Ok . um and that's my three so then I get two cards . Ok . Well that was nice . That's next . Ah three . Ah yeah . Ok so we have a Silver Gate . Tidal Palace and Lost Lagoon .  So Lost Lagoon is sunk . Alright so mine, I will . take . um . That . capture a treasure is one . Capture a treasure .  Are we capturing any of the other treasures? . Ah yeah we got the chalice and then you should give me the fire . Mmm . Ok so we have . Ok and then I'll . Yeah I'll give you the fire . And then, I will start . And then there's no need to stay there .  Yeah . I guess I'll start moving, I'll move one this way . Ok . Yeah now we have the cards for your guys .  You shoudl just go towards Fools' Landing . Ok . Yup .  So I got these two .  Draw three . So we have Bronze Gate . Flooded . Ah . Cave of Shadows is flooded . Mm . Ok and then Dunes of Deception is flood . This ok alright, we're good .  Now you're turn . Alright so first thing I'm gonna do is put this in . Ok . And then um, I think I should . So we only have three so we could . fly here and shore that up . Yeah . Ok . Just so you have the f- . So we so now all we have to do is get to Fool's Landing . close to you . Well I have to get the fire . We don't have to we have three out of four, you just need three . Out true that's right .  We don't even need all four, did we get all four last time? . Oh really? . Yup . We did but I mean . Might as well just go for it . It'll just be a longer time now . Let's see . Um alright so . Alright and then ah . Misty Marsh . and Howling Garden . and Cave of Embers top there . Okay . Ok cool .  Is it my turn now? . Alright . Mmhmm . Yeah . Ok so . um I guess I'll just move one . Yeah it doesn't matter .  I think you can just capture . I'll get it just cause why not . Yeah why not . Alright and then move . And then move here . and the moving . Ok then you get two . You have a Water's Rise . and Helicopter Lift which is awesome . Yeah . Ok so Water's Rise um . Still three though luckily . That's still three . Alright so Coral Palace . Observatory and Watch . Hmm . tower . Oh . Oh . Now we gotta shuffle . Apologies I forgot to shuffle . Ahh I got too excited cause we're gonna win . Hmm . Alright . Put on top . Ok that's three alright sorry, so Cave of Embers, so that's sunk . three . Yup . Alright . Ah Dunes of Deception, that's sunk and . Cave of Shadows . That is now flooded .  Ok . Alright so now it's my turn? Alright . T, yes . Hmm . Ok so I will just move . I can Helicopter Lift you there at no expense . hmm . Ok yeah Helicopter, move done . Yeah then you can Helicopter us out and we're done . Helicopter us out and we're done . Ok . There we go . I got so excited there . Cool ah that was nice . Hmm .

Oh yeah you move ok . I guess . I should move . And then . That will be one turn, flip this second turn and then flip the adjacent's third turn . Yeah I like that . Mhm . So move, that's one . Good idea . Two, and then this is three . Nice . Ok . Great . Your turn . Ok now . These are for you . Oh yeah . Uh Water's Rise of course . Yeah . Okay . (--) is now . So there goes that . two, um Gold Gate and Phantom Rock . Oh bye Phantom Rock . Oh bye Gold Gate . Yup there they go .  Alright . Oh . That's sadness alright . Well do either of those have like treasures on them? . Nope they are both unimportant . So . Here can you put that over there? . No biggy . Ok . Alright .  Your turn . So, me . Um . I don't know what to do, there's nothing to exciting though, I guess I should . move or? . Well that's your . Should I stay where I am? . Mmm . yeah I don't know what you should do . Um . You could . Yeah I don't have any cool powers . What's your special power again? . You could like . I could give you this . if you really want it . No one really . Needs anything quite yet . But then you couldn't yeah you're . Maybe . then I don't have to bump off one which wouldn't be a bad idea . I would go with yeah yeah . Well . Hmmm . So . um . You could always just . One . two and then flip the Lost Lagoon if you wanted to . Oh yeah you're right, why don't I do that .  One, two . Fliperoo yeah now we're . Sounds good .  Hmm . not flooded at all .  Ok . Good idea . Sandbags and whatever that is, thank you . There goes two . Breaker's Bridge .  Oh thank you . Good . Yeah . Cliffs of Abandon . Ok . Not bad . Ok . And you're up . Alright . Let's save . So you're on Fool's Landing . I could go to . I guess you just move and then flip flip like . Um . Yeah . Yeah . One . Do it two separate times . Two . One move . three . two moves . Ok . Alright . then two of these guys . We got a Heliicopter and one of the fires . Alright . Thank you . Mhm . Alright Lost Lagoon ans Whispering Gardens . Ok . Mmm . so I didn't-- . Oh no big deal . no . Is that-- . Hmm? . Ok . Thank you . Back in the pile . Thanks . Ok . So . You're up . Hmm, hmm, hmm, I should . I don't know I'm gonna keep flipping until we get like treasure cards I guess like I don't know . Yeah . Yeah I guess I should flip that over .  You're red right? Yeah . Are you? . Yeah so I'll flip that . We didn 't flip that . Then I can just move and flip that like . And then I can just move and flip that like I don't know what else we should do . Yeah we agree . Do you want to if you move to this one then you'll be close to this guy, like in position if we get another red card . Oh that's true . Oh yeah that's true .  You should give me the red one I guess eventually . Yeah . Yeah . Cause if you do that,that's one more move . Ok . Then you can flip the other guys if you really wanted to . Oh yeah . Ok . Ok . Is three . Good call . So here are your two treasure cards . Ooo got the flame .  Opp, ok . Nice . Sweet! . Alright and then two . Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate . Iron Gate . Oh . Temple . Um . here we are . Ok . Ok . Perfect Ok . Now I am . Not really doin' much . Um . Do you think I should . I guess . Stay there in case I get a fire and I could just give it . right to you? . But I got . Oh wait you have to be on . Yeah cause I guess it doesn't matter either way really . That's true cause I can just schootch one over and get rid of the fire . Yeah . So . Mmm . Do you want to move closer to one of these tiles? . Yeah sure let's see . There's one down here . Ah there's one up there .  Oh there's one down there so I can go . There's one below and then one up high . One . two . Should I go all the way down just . for fun? . Yeah I can just hagnout there I guess . (--) yeah .  Ok, I'll be there in case anyone needs me . Sure . Ok . So ah, uh, uh alright well I have alot of cards now . Oh I'm gonna use this immediately, so it . Oh wait . doesn't matter . So . Ok . Oh yeah you have to do those right? . So oh so we're in three now? . Mm, ok . Hope it's going to help . Three . Iron Gate . By Iron Gate . Hmm . Mm bye! . Um, Breaker's Bridge . Ah that's this one . (--) card . oh right . And Lost Lagoon is right next to it . Ok . not bad . Ok . And that's it . Could have been worse . Alright so, I'm gonna . You're up . Get on the same tile cause I . And we'll get rid of that one .  And then you need to discard one . Thank you . Ok . We're not . Yeah four . We're closer to the we're closer to this guy than the water guy . Yeah . Ok . So we can just put this over here . So . Ok and then . You could Helicopter us both . I guess . to . that one and then for my turn . I-- . I'll just capture the treasure . Sure . Yeah . I think I'm just gonna Helicopter you though . Ok . Ok . I don't think I need to Helicopter cause then I'm just gonna . Ok yeah . Since that dones't do two turns . I'm just gonna flip . Oh yeah good idea . one of these . Ok . So you don't get trapped somewhere . Yeah definitely . Ok . And then I need . Ok . So you have to get rid of your Helicopter Lift card . Oh right . Alright . And then draw two . And three . Ah Sandbag and then this . oh goodie . Ok . thingy . Ok and then there's those three . Hm . Alright I've got Temple of the Moon, bye Temple of the Moon . Hmm .  Hmm . Bye, bye . It got Cliffs of Abandonment . Hmm . Oh . or Cliffs of Abandon . Hmm . Um . And Whispering Garden .  Oop . right next to it . Not bad . Ok . Ok . So I'm going to capture . Thank you . Hm . A flame . Right . So if you want to put those over there . Good work . Sure thing . And then . I guess . I can does that yeah that cancel a turn so then . Mmm . I'll . I'll just like move . closer to this one maybe? . Yeah . Mm . So like work on . saving this area . Yeah and if you . like . You could probably like move it, flip them over . Well I think I would have to move to get close, I already used on turn so just moving . Well how many, yeah what are you on? . Ok . Duce . (--) take up my turns . Yeah, yeah . So I'll just go . One, two so the later I can flip both . Ok . That's fine . Then I can um . Oh yeah we both got Sandbags . You can Sandbag . this guy . sounds good . And that doesn't count as a turn . And so now . Oh wait I never . Let's just do our treasure cards . drew my stuff . Oh shoot, I'm sorry . Ok . There's two . There's so much to remember . I know there really is . Ok . And then three . Oo . Oh good . I got this . Right um . Copper Gate, Crimson Forest and Howling Garden . Howling Garden . Yeah . Ok Copper Gate's right there . Hmm . And then Crimson Forest . Oh right above . ok . not bad . Ok so I already started mine . Flipped him over and that's done . And that wasn't a turn . Mmhmm . On . If I'm over here just chillin' . Mmhmm . Can, I don't know what else I should do . Wait . Can you . you can just give stuff, you can't really . What do you . Take-- . Ok so never mind . Oh yeah I can just get stuff . Do you want me to give . can I give more than one card at a time? . I would say we should give them to you eventually cause you have the two . Hmm . Ok . Yeah we can just the next couple turns . Yeah . If you can, you can like fly to me and give me that . For like your turn . Ok . So I should just hang out . Ok . Yeah . And I'll take . We su(--) ok um . Still on three, we're doin' alright . Ok . And,alright . Good news is nothing critical should be in danger . Hmm . Yeah . Cause we've got another one of these right there . Yeah true . Crimson Forest is dead . Oh by Crimson Forest . Oh . short lived . Copper Gate is also dead . Also dead . Alright, ha . And as is Howling Garden! Ok we gotta be careful because all we have left is the Whispering one . Yeah . Yeah ok . Gotta watch Whispering Garden . Alright . And now it's your turn . So I'm going to fly to you . We should . Yeah and then I'll get rid of my fire, because we already have that . Yeah . for one turn . And then I'm gonna give you . Yeah . And then you can give me that . This guy . So that's two turns . Ok . And then . Ok . Oh this doesnt count as, I'll just leave this . (--) . Yeah save that for something important . Yeah well Lost Lagoon doesn't matter . Yeah I don't . Ok . Do you want me to give you one of these? . Hm-- . Or . Do you want to hold . No we should wait until we see .  Like you could draw a second one right now so . Yeah . Mmhmm . That's true . I got another Helicopter and I drew another one . Yeah .  Hmm . Oh perfect . And then three Flood cards please . Oh right . There we go . Thank you . Alright we got L . Lost Lagoon . by whopp, nope, we have Whisering Garden, Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon . So there's Lost Lagoon . Ok . We gotta pay attention to Whispering Garden . Whispering Garden, should, so I can save that and then give at the same time . And then . Yeah good idea . Yeah . And then Cities of Abandon also died . Bye bye . Ok . Alright so that's gonna be a little harder to move . Yeah . ok so I'm gonna . Yeah . shore up this one . Good idea . and then . I would like to . give one but I have to get . to you . Oh yeah . so . Wait, can I use this at any time? . Can you Helicopter her? . Yeah . Ok . It says at any time . Can I so . Yeah so . You want to fly me? . Yeah I would like to Helicopter you to our . Helicopter to me . Ok and then my other turn, and I'll give you that . Our tile . Ok . Give this me and I should . And then we're good . Get rid of . The Chalice . Ah the Chalice . Ok so then I need to give you a few cards . Yup . Oh wow, ok . Oh hah, . rats, ok . Ah . That's ok . Three . They've got our options . Yeah . Ok Silver Gate, Cave of Embers and Breaker's Bridge . Well here's Breaker's Bridge . Mmm . Ok . There you go . Ok . Ok now it's my turn . and you should capture . and I'm going to . capture the . treasure . over here and that was . stuff . one turn . yeah . Um . Mmm . go up . can you give . that . card? . Oh yeah can I? . Yeah I'll take, yeah I have enough space for one . yeah . cause we're on the same tile right now so you and I shouldn't move so I can give you the last one . I gave it to you . unless . Mmhmm . Oh yeah . And then eventually you could just Helicopter or something, or like pilot . Yeah I can move . So . Ok so . That's my turn . yeah . And then one, two . We're good here . and . two, three, we are going . to . flip you . Bronze gate yeah . Bronze Gate yeah, and . Coral Palace . All done . Ok . So . And we're going, we're going after the Lion one? . Oh . Is that right? . Yeah we're going to get . Ok got it . Yes . And then . No cause we already have two so we don't have to worry about the Chalice . Yeah . Yeah ok . So . We could go for either, but it doesn't really matter . Yeah that's what I was thinking .  But we have all the Lions like on the . On the board already, like we would have to wait for another Chalice to come up . We have another Chalice . Oh shoot I . Hmm . didn't even see that .  Ok . Ah doesn't . Um . So . I guess it would . is it still your turn? . No I just finished my turn so it's your turn . Ok . So I can't do . anything, I mean . you could like . You want . sandbag something? Do you need anything? . If we . If you wanted to get rid of all of those Chalice ones I could give you all these Lions ones (--) get the Lion one . Instead of waiting . for you to give . The chalice . Mmm . Yeah . Yeah . Want to do that? . You want to give her all three? . And then . And then or can you . Wait . Ah cause I don't want to fly you cause we only have one on the board right now . Mmhmm . True . So I could . Yeah . So we need you to get to a Lion . You shh . You should give me all of them and then . Oh . Wait . And that's three . S . But if I fly you you wont' be able to get out of . Well can she get to that using three moves, she has the one, two . Not quite . We could try . Once we're on this though I guess we can just like . But to get the treasure . keep drawing . if you want, if I flew to whispering garden . and then . just saved . like . This one or something . And Sandbagged another one . mmhmm . Then . on your next turn you could give that to me . So it would be save either . If you two stay on the same tile, I could fly you to me . And then . Ok . Does that make sense? . Yeah . Ok I'm like thinking . I trust you . Alright . I hope it works out . Ok so what are you doing right now? . I'll watch as it goes . Oh . Alright . So I think . I'm gonna fly here . Ok . So and now we're gonna . Wait . Mmmmaybe . Yeah I think you should fly there . And then my turn I'll give you the four . Yeah . And then your turn you give me that so that either way we're kind of set . Yeah . Mmhmm . Yeah . Yeah . so . I'll fly here . So fly to Whispering Gardens . Ok . And that's one move and then . And then . And you might as well like flip something while your there . Yeah, flip over that or . Yeah . keep an open path . Oh . Does it matter which one . Yeah . Yeah . And then I do have a Sandbag also so . Do you want to save Coral Palace? Yeah . I would yeah . Yeah . and that's three with the Sandbag . good call . Ok . Ok . And then I got two of these . Yup . Wait I got a Chalice and . Oh goodie . Did-- . Fire . And then . Ok and then there's three . Ok . Thank you . So there's those . Alright we have Misty Marsh, Temple of the Sun and Tidal Palace . Temple of the Sun (--) cause they're all (near this side) . Oh we're on it . Oh we're standing on it . And then . Tidal Palace is that? . Mmhmm, ah I just flipped that over . Oh ok, . Yeah . Then . good . Good stuff . What do you think? . Thank you . Alright . And you're up . So . I should . oh wait . Oh . I would give a lot of cards . Did I? . Get rid of the flame . Get rid of, yeah get rid of flame . Oh yeah .  By flame . Doesn't matter . Ok so I'm gonna . Just give you this, oh wait we have to be on the same tile . Oh that's right . Yeah . Crap forgot about that rule . Ah I can't oh yeah I don't want to Helicopter you . Ah . Precisley and . You can give it me and I'm aloud to give it to her even though she's not on the same tile, so I can do that nextturn . Yeah . good call . Right? yeah . Ok . so I'll take it . And then . That's one turn . Should that just be . Oh you don't even have to cause I can just take hers . like . my-- . Now you need four . Oh . You're right . So you don't have to waste one of your turns on that if you don't want to . Oh yeah . Ok . redo . So you should try to get to you should be getting on to . Coral Palace . Alright yeah . Ok . so I'll just move twice and then . Yeah . Yeah that's a good idea . Call it a day . Wait you can move three times and end up on Fool's Landing if you want so we can fly out of there . But she has to get the s-- . Well if I want to capture, I might as well just be . Oh but . Oh that's right . You're the one capturing though . We only need one more . Yeah I can capture . So ok, so I'll just . Yeah so just . just go to Fool's Landing, that's a good idea . One,two, three . Good . Ok . and then . and then . Yeah and then here's your two . I should, oh yeah . two first . Of course, Water's Rise . Ah . this could mess us all up, I could die . Oh gosh . Um . So . No we won't let you die . Oh, . gotta do this whole thing . Mm . Mmm . Alright . Three . Oh I did not grab three, I grabbed four .  Alright . Eh . Um . Dunes of Deception, Bronze Gate and Silver Gate . So that's . Ok everything's dead, . Yeah . Oh that's sad . Wait . And then dunes, which one did you grab? Ok . And then same . Silver Gate we can just flip over . So Silver Gate's staying and then those two .  Cool . But Bronze Gate . Yup . Thank you . Mhm . Ok . No it's my turn, I'm going to give you this . Mmhmm and then . Even though we're not on the same tile . I'll get rid of this . Then . (--) . Should you . I could go one, two, oh I could just go one, two, three . Oh you need, you already used one move . Well that was . Oh I already used one, ok . Should I just move two for fun? . or . Sure . ok . that works . One, two . Yeah . Yeah . So . And now . these two, so useful . Three of these, Misty Marsh . is dead . Yeah . Oh . Um Whispering Gardens . Whoo! . What happened? . Ok and Cave of Embers is dead . Ok . Thank you . Alright so . So capture, hm . (--) is going to be my first move to you, capture . Mmhmm . (--) . This . This guy . Ok . Ah and I have two more moves . So I think . Hmm . I'm gonna fly here . Mmm . And then . Ok . Wait for you . Can you fly here and then fly me with you? Or is that only a Helicopter thing? ok . We should wait, save that . Na I'd have to use, or you have a Helicopter . Oh yeah . I could do that, so I'm gonna go back, go fly here . Oh ok . Fly us . With the Helicopter . there ok . so then you used yours . And then my turn and then do these guys . So . Bd, da, da, da, da, . Oh I got a Sandbag and . the chalice . These don't really matter but . And yeah . Well they could . Might as well do it . Tidal Palace, Temple of the Sun . By . Where are you Temple of the Sun? . Over here done . Oh dead . Oh . and Breaker's Bridge . Oh well still alive . Ok . And then my turn, we're saved! . You're gonna Helicopter us away! . Whoo! Fly home . Oh yeah! . Snap . Nice work . This is exciting . Yeah, this game's alot of fun . Mmm .

Alright . So you have two of those . So we'll try to get all those to you once we get them . Yeah . Yeah . Alright, should I just do the like . Shore up these two, move and then shore up these two . Yeah . Yeah let's do that . Oh Water's Rise . (--) already . Already . Um you gotta . So oh right, right right right right thank you . And you had to discard that one too . Yes I forgot to to do that last time . I don't know why I'm looking at it while I'm shuffling, that's kinda cheating . Right and that's two . Right yeah ok . Breaker's Bridge and Lost Lagoon . (--) yeah those two right there . Ok . So I'm on Silver Gate . Should I just . Move to Break . er's Bridge and shore that up? . Sure . Yeah that works . I don't see anything else do to . One two . Ok . Sandbags Lion . Good . So we have two of everthing except for that purple one right? . And then . Cliffs of Abandon, Temple of the Moon . Ok so . you're there so you should shore that up .  Wait . You're red . No that's me yeah . Um, I'm on Fool's Landing yeah . Ok . Fool's Landing ok . He could fly there . I could . And shore that one up and shore the one next to it up . Yeah . Ok . Would that be three actions? . Yeah . Does flight count? Flight counts as one yeah . It goes one, two three yeah . Yeah unless you use the Helicopter Card or the Helicopter Lift but that's unnecessary . Yeah we should save that though .  So I'll fly . Mmhmm . Here . And then shore it up . This one . Ok and then two treasure cards . Two treasure cards . Helicopter Lift again, and then the chalice . So we only need one more of those . Um . So yeah just one more . Well you're you're on the same tile as her . So I'm oh wait that now beause yeah . You can't do that now though he has to wait for his turn . Is your turn oh yeah .  You're right, you're right . Yeah ok .  Do you want to do these? . That would be another action to . Yeah . Yeah . Gold Gate and Phanthom Rock . Phanthom Rock's gone and Gold Gate's gone . So is Gold Gate . That was quick . Ok you're turn . Should I give these cards to him? . Now since I don't really have anything else to do . like these two? . You could . Because I could fly to . Mm yeah . Alright . Oh we still need another one, but should I just do this now anyways? . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I would, I would just get rid of . Yeah . Ok and then you'll have to . get rid of the . You have to get rid of one of them . Earth one I guess .  The purple one . Yeah . So that's, that would be . Should I do anything else? . Two . Two yeah . You where are you? Temple of the Moon? . Move here, I don't know if it's worth doing anything . I mean . Cause i can't shore anything up or do anything reallyI can just move . But you could still like move closer to something else . Which might be helpful in the end . So the next treasure, where's the Lion treasure? . Should I just move down here ta? . Yeah . Up there, up there they're down here . Up there or there . Yeah I'll try moving to one of those cause . I would move down here . Ok . Yeah . Ok . Ah well you didn't have, these, these were first . Right sorry yeah thank you . ha . Oh . Damn . Um and then two of these . Ok cool . Iron Gate . And Whispering Garden . That's Iron Gate . Ok . Ok my turn soooo . You can give . Cards to anyone right? . Mmmhmm . So . And you guys are both on that tile . I mean . I guess I . But I can't give it to her she can't take it . Ok . Yeah . I could give you the fire one though . Yeah . Ah . well . Ah . What else is there to to? . Um . And . or should you . I . Can you move up? No you can't move up close enough to save Whispering Garden . I can't move wait . one, two, no I can't . But we have Howling Garden . Yeah . Mmhmm . I should shore up . No I think you can save it . Ah I need to shore up Lost Lagoon . I guess just . Give you the fire and . and move closer to Howling Garden . Sure . Ok one . Two three . Now Treasure cards . Water's Rise . That's dissapointing . Mmm, should we Sandbag WHispering Gardens or should we not worry about it . I don't think we should worry about it . Ok . Oh now we're on three .  Ok . Yeah . Cliffs of Abandon, Breaker's Bridge, Lost Lagoon . You lost the Lost Lagoon sorry . Not too bad . he's lost already . Ah . Ok . Um it's you . Ok . So . I have three . Where am I again? Oh over there . Over here I guess I should just stay on your thingy and you should give all three of them to me for mine . Um I guess . If I . Why don't you go to mine and then I can give you this so you ahve all four . And then capture it . Well . Hang on . Oh wait it'll have to be on a different turn . Yeah . But . Wouldn't that be because if I used one action . Oh wait are you saying it has to be a different turn cause you have to give it to me? . Yeah . Just use one action . You could use the Helicooter well she can just move . Mmhmm . I think you should . Shore up Cliffs of Abandon for sure . I got it . And the move two at the same time .  Sorry . Or he could even just . move there and I could meet him there I guess . Move to here . to the . the place you're gonna need to be for this . Coral Palace, yeah do that . Right here . So that was . Sure . Two . Two . Two . I don't . think we need to do anything else unless you want . Mmm no . to move . her here with your Helicopter Lift . Mmm . Um . I think we . Sure-he's gonna have to discard one anyways . because . Yeah . So you might as well use it . ok . Party at Coral Palace . And the end of the (--) . Alright . Alright so treasure . draw two . Sandbag's and the Lion . I guess get rid of the Lion maybe . Ihave what, three, four, five six, I can just use the Sandbag . Or . Or should I get rid of the Sandbag . Can you . I guess (--) . I think . Your turn's over . Oh but you can use it at any time . You can use it at any time . Well . But can you use it if it's still in your like if you need to disacrd one? . Yeah I think you have to discard it . Yeha I don't think you have the choice of using it . Oh well . Ok . Ok is it my turn? . No we have to do three of these . Ok Iron Gate . So that's done . Whispering Garden . I don't know . I guess I'll just be careful of that one . Yeah definitely ok . mmhmm . So your turn . So give him the chalice . Mm yeah . ta . and then maybe . He has to discard something . Will we have to discard . Discard the Helicopter Lift with the Lion . Discard the lion . The two Lions . Yeah discard the Lion . Um . And then you should move . How many turns to you? That was one . That was one .  So I, I can shore up, I can move and shope up this one but I won't be able to get to that one . yeah . Should I just do that anyways or . Yeah . Mmhmm . One . Ok . Ok and then two of these . Oh . Good . Alright so we have three of . The lions . The lion and three of the fire . Cool, cool . Um and then three of these . One of these . Alright . Temple of the Sun, Crimson Forest and Copper Gate . Temple of the Sun . Crimson Forest is there above that . One of these yeah . Temple of the Moon or Temple of the Sun . Mmhmm . Right so it's my turn . And you have Sandbags so . I do have Sandbags, that is true . But can't, she can just move there can't she? . But we can just move yeah mmhmm . Should I move to Temple of the Sun or Temple of the Moon? . Move to Temple of the Moon since that's part of everything else I guess . Ok . Mmhmm . Yeah . So . Three . Huh Water's Rise . Rats . Ok . Copper Gate . Temple of the Moon . Crimson Forest . We lost Copper Gate and Crimson Forest . And Crimson Forest yeah . But we still have Temple of the Moon . Mmhmm . Yeah before it sank . Before it . went down . Ok so now you can do the thing . Wait is it still your turn? . No . No it's your turn . Nope, she finished yeah . Oh ok . oh . Discard . Mm . So that was one action . ta . That was one . You should move to Temple of the Moon or Sun and . And flip it . Flip it . Yeah . Ah . What you're . blue? . Yeah but I can . You can only go here then oh . I can fly to either of them . Maybe . Temple of the Moon since . Yeah . Right now . (--) . We don't have . A purple yet though . But there's nothing, I mean you might as well . Might as well just shore it up now . Shore up one, yeah .  It's not like you can, I don't know is there anything else to do really? . I would the (--) because it's more likely . Cause if we get a Water's Rise card we'll be flipped right over and definitely be pulled to that . Yeah . Yeah . Ok . So that was three . So now treasure cards . Mmmhmm . Cards . Helicopter and Purple . Ok . So we have three of everything . And then . We need these . Mmhmm . (--) . Breaker's Bridge . Cliffs of Abandon . Temple of the Sun . (--) . Oh . Shoot . Ugh . I feel like that works . Alright go ahead . Um should I just shore up these two? . Yes . Yeah . And then . Should I move to you and give you this? . I'll take it . What else to do . Oh now I . Um is that all your moves? . Ok . Yeah I think it is . Oh awesome . Just discard one of them . Yeah hmm . Mm and then three of those . Ok . Tidal Palace, Silver Gate . And Dunes of Deception . Ok . My turn . yeah so you have three lions . Yeah . So I'll start moving down to Howling Garden . Ok yeah . Is there anything else I should do? . I don't think so . Ok .

Yeah we already have ok . ok and then three of these . Embers Bronze Gate, Cave of Shadows . Where's Cave of Shadows? Oh there it is . So you should probably shore up Cave of Shadows . Cause I need to get there . Are you talking to me . Ok should I just . Yeah . Yeah . Where am I? I'm over there . Your're the blue, just go to Cave of Shadows and shore it up . Or you could just fly to Fool's Landing and flip over Cave of Shadows . And just wait for us to (--) those and come back . Yeah, yeah . Ok . But I should just, can't i just . I could also use a Helicopter Lift to fly . But she's right here anyways, yeah . I just need to move one yeah . (--) oh you're already you only need to move one yeah . So just fly to Fool's Landing .

Yeah why don't we try to do that?.If anyone ends up with another.one of those Lions.Ok.Um did you draw yet.Ok.No.(--).Water Rises never fails.Yeah.So we're up to three now.So this goes.Thank you.This goes right here and then we shuffle these.Back.I got the fourth one.Mmm.And I gotta take three right?.Yes.We're gonna lose Temple.Mmhmm.Oh that's why.Ok we got Lost Lagoon, Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon.Temple's gone, Iron Gate's gone.Sure.Lost Lagoon's flipped..Ok.Ok.We're losing land..faster the most.Ok.Um.Well.t,t,t.and worthwhile give it or.Yeah.Unless you just want to.move and flip Lost Lagoon.Well hold on I have five here so I should give away.Wait you could make me the grabber. You give me one, you give me two, then we're done here..Except you can't fly us here.Maybe.Or we could both give you the fire so you could have four fire.True we could do that.You could give him two chalices just so he has something going..Do those Helicopter Lifts.Then I'd have to discard. I have four already..That's true we could just fly down there now, that doesn't really make.Either way.And that'll get rid of one of your cards at least.If we use the lift.If where do we go?.To the fire?.Or.Think so.Yeah I think that's the first one well get.Are you aloud to fly us all as one action?.Yeah.Actually it wouldn't even be an action. It would just be using this special action card.So it wouldn't, I could it I think out of my turn even.Yeah do ti right now yeah.Right.Save the Helicopter.Yes so you guys want to do that now?.Sure.Yeah so.(--).Where should we go though which one?.So.So.Ah I would say that one..Right here it's the most central.(--) far ok.Oh no that.Ok so you have three cards.So yeah you can give me one cause I'm gonna give one away next turn.Um.anyway.You could give both if you want to.Ok.This.And.Hmm.I have to get rid of.Mmhmm.Two if I want to keep all the cards.But.We could all, you could use Sandbag.We're.I'll just give you these for now.Oh actually if you give him these like Moon things I can give him one of those too.That's true.Hmm, um..I'm gonna do these for now..Three.(--).Reactions.yeah.(--).Treasure.What was, what was the first thing I did?.Wait no actually I don't.Oh no that was just two.(--).Did you shore something up?.No.This is the only whatever that thing is the only.I don't think there's anything I could really do.Yeah we lost the other one.That's the only one that's left near the end.So we have to be sure we get that.Yeah.You know how to stay.That.(--).If we Sandbag it is ti permanently protected?.No, no.No, no.No.No (--) save a flooded one.Go ahead.Ok.We're doing pretty good.Cool.Three of these.K Breaker's Bridge.Ok.Cliffs of Abandon.Ok.Whispering Garden.Ok don't care about this.So.Alright.Right.So I wanna give.This to you, right? That's one action..Cause I could take a Lion if you want.Yeah do you want it.Well wait.But yeah actually.Cause I'll give you this one and I'll give him that one.Ok yeah.I'm just worried that we're gonna start losing all the.That's ok though we don't these like we just need to keeo these five.Yeah.It just feels wrong.Here it doens't matter.Yeah right, it dones't matter.Yeah.If we need it.Ok.Cause we got what'd we got?.Ok so then that's the only thing you need to do right?.(--) yeah.I probably should have moved to there.I know that you.Yeah.Do you have any actions left?.I just drew the cards anyway so I'm done.I know that's true.Ok so water.Yeah the flood cards.Ok Copper Gate, Howling Garden..Ok so that (--).We lost that one?.No ah well Copper Gate, ok.Oh ok.Oh.Copper Gate's right there.Both gardens now?.And Crimson Forest, is here.Ok.Ok.So if we get a Water's Rise we can Sandbag it at that point.But it would have to be before we draw the carsd yeah.Thanks.Right, right right.Yeah it has to be before.Thanks.Alright so I'll give you this.Wait, it's my turn right? Yeah..I'll give you that.Yeah it is your turn..I'll give oh shoot, we'll get the (--).Yeah.Yup.(--).Give you that.And then I'll just ah.Just stay there I guess.I'll take two more treasures.(--) Water's Rise.So um we probably want to sandbag the Howling gardens just to save it.Do we want to make some.In case?.Or I could ah, this is kind of far away but I could go here and save two and once.I could reach that one..We just don't have to worry about those at all.But.Yeah it's happening.It's gonna happen now so that they could flip it.Ok.So Lost Lagoon.Copper Gate and Howling Garden's so that was good.Ooo.Ah.(--).Lost Lagoon's gone, Copper Gate is gone..So that's in there.Alright.Alright so I want to capture that, right?.Yup.Where do these go?.Discard.Discared.I know.I guess I better save this right?.Ta.Or if you give me the Lion then I can.Ok that's number two.We can still Sandbag it if we have to.Yeah we always have to Sandbag.We can do that at any time right?.And we get this one on the next turn.Yeah I have one more.Yeah.Yeah.What.(--) on my turn so.Do you want to Sandbag it before I pull it again?.Well just before Water's Rise.So if he flips the Water's Rise card he can just use it at that point.We don't have to worry about it yeah.I'm not sure that's the rules, but if you say so that's ok.Isn't that what we just did.Yeah it's the rules, it's the rules, yeah that's what we just did..Is.But.That is what we just did but.That's the rules..I mean if I sink you can't.Sandbag it after.No it's not.So we're with.Well.You can't sink it that way, it just came up.Cause the card is right there.Unless there's multiple cards of each.That's what I'm wondering about.There aren't.Yeah there's just one of each.Yeah.Oh ok.So we have it here, unless we shuffle back in we can't get it.alright so one two, what's my third one.No.Ah you.Yeah so you're (--) that.No you still need a third.You could start to, you could start to move towards Fool's Landing.We could go here yeah we

a card to anybody and you don't have to be on the same . Mmhmm . no yeah that's my thing . I missed that part ok . So I go first um . You're up Engineer . Ok yup . Oh let's clean up some stuff . (--) . Oh . Oh . Oh ok perfect, even better . Oh that was nice . Minor . Yeah . Work your magic . So it looks the same as last time . So one move, is it the same? . I think you, you last time you did this one first . What? Do yours . And then move to and then . I can do . I split my ah . two tiles for one action . Yeah so you did that and Whispering Garden . So half and action? . That's one action . Ok . Then you move to WHispering Garden and did the other two . That's what you did last time . Ok that's three then . Hmm . Alright . and ah . Alright . Yup . Two treasure . (--) everything you're saying . Alright . Ok Water Rise . Shuffle . Oh wait so shuffle these ones and put them on the top first . Oh . I thought they'd clean the place up while we were gone . Now I take ah two right? . Mmhmm . I still think we're allowed to cheat and we just don't know it . Yeah . Alright Whispering Gardens and Cities of Abandon . And a . ok . (--) . Alright . Ok Messenger . (--) gotta be separate . Oh this yeah . So I know . Um ok so I'm . This is . (--) . So I'm good . At least . For Whispering Gardens I think . Make sure that's ok . I think we were struggling to get the card in the right order first . There . Oh so that's one action um . Sorry I didn't (--) . Now . Cause you . Cause we end up having too many cards and discarding like I would never have cards and just discarding liek I would never have cards . You can . You're . Yeah . You, you were the only one who could give it to anybody regardless of and that that's probably an important power that we use . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah so I think I'm gonna go back . And go to you . You need to shore up Cliffs . and shore up this one . Mmhmm . Hmm . Nice . Alright . And then . Draw two . Phanthom Rock and Breaker's Bridge . Phanthom's Rock is gone . (Oh well) . Don't need that one . So I'm wondering if you shouldn't be . Whenever possible cause you can give them away anywhere . I will . I'm just worried that we'll like . I just don't know . I run out of cards alot so people end up having to discard . Yeah . True . Like I usually end up . Having too many . Is it my . Yeah it's your turn yeah . Mmm . Yeah (--) . I could move and just . shore up Breaker's BRidge . That's them right . Sure . Yeah (--) . You could move to where we are . Oh sure cause you want to trade . Yeah we could trade cards . (--) . I could do this and then I could use my power . Oh true, yeah ok . Alright . (--) . Cool . That's up three . Alright I need another lift . Cool . Take two more floods . Golden Gate and Lost Lagoon . Gone . Do we have to show (--) . Only when we get the . Not yet . not until . whatever that is, Water Rising . Do we do Lost Lagoon? . Yeah . So . So when we get the ah . Water rising card that's when we shuffle? . ta so . I guess I'll go shore up . Go here (special) up here . and then I'll . We don't really know who needs what yet or anything? . So I'll shore up this one . Ah . Not really . (--) . I took two treasures . Ok . I think it's smart for us to all be closer together . Hmmm . And then two of these . It's all full . Seems like that is . This . Temple of the Moon . And Iron Gate . Ok . (--) . Well there's nothing, I can shore up but there's nothing for me to do you want me to just give you the cards? . Hmmm . One . (--) . I can I can give you your fifth one and I give you one then you could . You could . ta . Give you um . Mmm . Let's see . I don't know who needs . We have enough to do five . Well you're gonna get the fires .  We'll try to give those two you . Cause we're all, we're sittin' on you know . You could . Do you want to give . The Messenger the chalice thing . Chalice . That would be good . So that's one move, what else . Ah . (--) . ta . So I don't know what to do . I honestly just think stay put because then we can give you our . Yeah . Keep trading and keep protecting this area . Cards . I got two more moves, should I do anything? . You can't shore anything up so . And . feels like a waste but doesn't look like there's anything . (--) . to do . Ok . unless we want to . shore up . Temple of the Moon . Actually you can't even get there . You can't do it there . Ok . Yeah . No you can't (--) that one . and we could also come down here and just like save these . like spaces . They're closer together . Yeah if we could . Cause we don't really care about these as much you know? . We could all move with the Helicopter Lift if we wanted to all at once if we wanted to . That's true . Can we do opposite ones or just two? . yeah I oh ah . One or more pawns . Oh . Yeah well . Yeah we could just move down there . So we could all move at any time . If we could get . That's true yeah let's just hang out together yeah . You have one more of these cards we could take that and fly us all down to here . Whatever . That's true .  Yeah why don't we try to do that? . If anyone ends up with another . one of those Lions . Ok . Um did you draw yet . Ok . No . (--) . Water Rises never fails . Yeah . So we're up to three now . So this goes . Thank you . This goes right here and then we shuffle these . Back . I got the fourth one . Mmm . And I gotta take three right? . Yes . We're gonna lose Temple . Mmhmm . Oh that's why . Ok we got Lost Lagoon, Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon . Temple's gone, Iron Gate's gone . Sure . Lost Lagoon's flipped . Ok . Ok . We're losing land . faster the most . Ok . Um . Well . t,t,t . and worthwhile give it or . Yeah . Unless you just want to . move and flip Lost Lagoon . Well hold on I have five here so I should give away . Wait you could make me the grabber .  You give me one, you give me two, then we're done here . Except you can't fly us here . Maybe . Or we could both give you the fire so you could have four fire . True we could do that . You could give him two chalices just so he has something going . Do those Helicopter Lifts . Then I'd have to discard .  I have four already . That's true we could just fly down there now, that doesn't really make . Either way . And that'll get rid of one of your cards at least . If we use the lift . If where do we go? . To the fire? . Or . Think so . Yeah I think that's the first one well get . Are you aloud to fly us all as one action? . Yeah . Actually it wouldn't even be an action .  It would just be using this special action card . So it wouldn't, I could it I think out of my turn even . Yeah do ti right now yeah . Right . Save the Helicopter . Yes so you guys want to do that now? . Sure . Yeah so . (--) . Where should we go though which one? . So . So . Ah I would say that one . Right here it's the most central . (--) far ok . Oh no that . Ok so you have three cards . So yeah you can give me one cause I'm gonna give one away next turn . Um . anyway . You could give both if you want to . Ok . This . And . Hmm . I have to get rid of . Mmhmm . Two if I want to keep all the cards . But . We could all, you could use Sandbag . We're . I'll just give you these for now . Oh actually if you give him these like Moon things I can give him one of those too . That's true . Hmm, um . I'm gonna do these for now . Three . (--) . Reactions . yeah . (--) . Treasure . What was, what was the first thing I did? . Wait no actually I don't . Oh no that was just two . (--) . Did you shore something up? . No . This is the only whatever that thing is the only . I don't think there's anything I could really do . Yeah we lost the other one . That's the only one that's left near the end . So we have to be sure we get that . Yeah . You know how to stay . That . (--) . If we Sandbag it is ti permanently protected? . No, no . No, no . No . No (--) save a flooded one . Go ahead . Ok . We're doing pretty good . Cool . Three of these . K Breaker's Bridge . Ok . Cliffs of Abandon . Ok . Whispering Garden . Ok don't care about this . So . Alright . Right . So I wanna give . This to you, right? That's one action . Cause I could take a Lion if you want . Yeah do you want it . Well wait . But yeah actually . Cause I'll give you this one and I'll give him that one . Ok yeah . I'm just worried that we're gonna start losing all the . That's ok though we don't these like we just need to keeo these five . Yeah . It just feels wrong . Here it doens't matter . Yeah right, it dones't matter . Yeah . If we need it . Ok . Cause we got what'd we got? . Ok so then that's the only thing you need to do right? . (--) yeah . I probably should have moved to there . I know that you . Yeah . Do you have any actions left? . I just drew the cards anyway so I'm done . I know that's true . Ok so water . Yeah the flood cards . Ok Copper Gate, Howling Garden . Ok so that (--) . We lost that one? . No ah well Copper Gate, ok . Oh ok . Oh . Copper Gate's right there . Both gardens now? . And Crimson Forest, is here . Ok . Ok . So if we get a Water's Rise we can Sandbag it at that point . But it would have to be before we draw the carsd yeah . Thanks . Right, right right . Yeah it has to be before . Thanks . Alright so I'll give you this . Wait, it's my turn right? Yeah . I'll give you that . Yeah it is your turn . I'll give oh shoot, we'll get the (--) . Yeah . Yup . (--) . Give you that . And then I'll just ah . Just stay there I guess . I'll take two more treasures . (--) Water's Rise . So um we probably want to sandbag the Howling gardens just to save it . Do we want to make some . In case? . Or I could ah, this is kind of far away but I could go here and save two and once . I could reach that one . We just don't have to worry about those at all . But . Yeah it's happening . It's gonna happen now so that they could flip it . Ok . So Lost Lagoon . Copper Gate and Howling Garden's so that was good . Ooo . Ah . (--) . Lost Lagoon's gone, Copper Gate is gone . So that's in there . Alright . Alright so I want to capture that, right? . Yup . Where do these go? . Discard . Discared . I know . I guess I better save this right? . Ta . Or if you give me the Lion then I can . Ok that's number two . We can still Sandbag it if we have to . Yeah we always have to Sandbag . We can do that at any time right? . And we get this one on the next turn . Yeah I have one more . Yeah . Yeah . What . (--) on my turn so . Do you want to Sandbag it before I pull it again? . Well just before Water's Rise . So if he flips the Water's Rise card he can just use it at that point . We don't have to worry about it yeah . I'm not sure that's the rules, but if you say so that's ok . Isn't that what we just did . Yeah it's the rules, it's the rules, yeah that's what we just did . Is . But . That is what we just did but . That's the rules . I mean if I sink you can't . Sandbag it after . No it's not . So we're with . Well . You can't sink it that way, it just came up . Cause the card is right there . Unless there's multiple cards of each . That's what I'm wondering about . There aren't . Yeah there's just one of each . Yeah . Oh ok . So we have it here, unless we shuffle back in we can't get it . alright so one two, what's my third one . No . Ah you . Yeah so you're (--) that . No you still need a third . You could start to, you could start to move towards Fool's Landing . We could go here yeah we could go to the Watchtower so we could get Highland Gardens, like later . To let you know we have . That's a good idea . Mmhmm . I can save them both ok . Um . These guys right here . Yeah . Ok . We're good . Nice actually (--) go then . Yeah . And um . Right . Three Flood cards . Three . Ok goodbye . Whispering Gardens . Breaker's BRidge (--) Cliffs of Abandon . You all done? . Ok . Let an island go . Hm . One Flood card Hmm . I don't care about it . Yeah we need to . Alright . Alright . Ok um . Messenger . So . I guess go for . You guys both have those . Go to Fool's Landing I guess . This is so boring . Go there, go there and just save it yeah . Oh I might as well use it . So one . two . three . Oh boy . is that just throw away . In abundance . something . Not Sandbag . Alright . Alright . Do you have alot of . Ok . Silver Gate, Cave of Ember . (--) Silver gate . Crimson Forest . To the top . That's ok ok . Alright . Ok so . Temple? . Cash these in . Move wherever . Yeah . Nice . Mmhmm . Dunes of Deception, Coral Palace and Bronze Gate . I do . Ok . Alright so I will go . One, two cash them in . And then ahhh . Two treasure cards . Right . And three more floods . Misty Marsh, Temple of . Misty Marsh . And then . Alright . Hmm . Yeah (--) . (--) this one's there . Yeah just move there . If someone could fly me there and then we could use the last one . Actually yeah it could . It's like an air lift . The game's over . Yeah . I can flip cards but we don't need 'em right? . So just . Just moved it, yeah just go to Fool's Landing . yeah we're, we're out then . Yeah . Alright so someone fly me . And then ah . And then . and then fly . Yeah Helicopter . over there . And then Helciopter Lift dont' we . And then . Did it . Oh that was alot better .

Yeah I could, cause I could give these two to you anytime . Or vice versa . So maybe . Yeah well my, my ability is to give these to you for two turns so . Oh ok ok so I've got two more turns right here .  Two more turns . What is, what is your first move? . No, I didn't do anything yet ok .  So I as gonna go one, two . Ok .

Alright . So I will f . shore both of these .  Actually can I shore up two tiles for one action? . Nice . So . (--) . Yeah . So that's one . Yeah . (--) . Well I guess I'll try to get as close to the . Blue thing . as possible . Unless if she's on the same tile as me can I give her this? . (--) . I think only on your turn, cause that counts as one of your actions yeah . On my turn .  my turn . Ok . Mmhmm . So . I should go as close to that as I can . Yeah well yeah either one of these . Yeah . So that was one . Two, three . Ok . Ok . One two . Thank you . Ewww . Oh . Oh cool . Ok . Big decision . (--) that five . And that's five cards . Two . Whispering Garden and Iron Gate . Iron Gate's rigth here . (--) . Whisperin Garden . (--) . Ok so now me? . Yes . Um . I'm gonna give . THese two to you . So that's two turns right? . (--) . Right . I think that's one, cause you're a Messenger right? . ta . Give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island . Oh ok . for one action per card . One action per card so this would be two moves . Oh ok . Yeah . So that's two . that was two . But I only have three cards out .  I only have three . three . right . of the lions, lions ok . right . So hopefully . I'll get one of those sooner . Right . I think you need to get rid of a card now . Oh . Oh yes I do have to get rid of a card . Yeah . Yeah . Unless you want to Helo . Ah, Helicopter Lift us . The Howling Garden . I think he . He has to . get rid of one before he uses one now . Like at no time . Oh well . When I get well I'm gonna ha um . Right? . Then it would be as if he Helicopter Lift us before I gave him my cards . I could do this any time it doens't count as an action . I can do this and it doesn't count as an action .  So . Hmm . I could put . You're red . Yeah . I could put you there . Ok . Oh yeah yeah . Yeah yeah I'll put you there . And and that way I can give you the chalice . Yeah ok . Ok so we can use that even though . Yeah, yeah could move there . Yeah . That was six? . Well it was as if he used that first and then I gave my action of . Ah oh ok ok gotcha . So I have five . So let's put you here then right . Gotcha ok perfect . Ok so that's gone . Ok . So then that and I yield my third turn then . I'll take these two . Ok . And of course a Water's Rise . So . this goes up . These get shuffled . Mmhmm . And take three . Breaker's Bridge . Temple of the Moon . Oh right my bad . It's always Misty . And Iron Gate . is gone . gone . (--) (--) do I have the . Yeah . (--) card (--) . Ok . So I can take one action and fly to any . anywhere on the island . Ok . Do you want to . Oh . So, so no so I'm gonna take my tile and fly right here . Do you want to take me with you . Ok that's fine . Um . Why? . I don't know . No I don't, no that counts as one . Ok . (--) . Right, right . Ok so that's one turn . Second turn I can give you this . ta . Thank you . But then you need to discard one of your . Ok . Other cards . So I'll do . (--) . Doesn't matter . Yeah . I have one fire so . Well whcih one are we closest to? . I guess . He has one .

I can't fly .  I only get one per turn . Oh . Once per turn .  But I can move once . Mmm . Right but . How many moves, do you have any moves remaining? . I have one more move . I'd say, I'd say move right here and maybe I'd be able top get you . So what if you . If I get another one of these cards I can get that to you . Ok . Ok so I'll move there . Oh . On the, on the chance that we . I'll move there ok . Oh ok never mind . So that's three, I get two of these . Or maybe yeah . Sandbag, oh got four of those . Ok well great, so then next turn .

Five . One, two, three how many . Who has . Oh ok . Oh . Oh I have too many . Ok so . Do you want to Sandbag? . Yeah . Get rid of . Somethin' . Can I give this . Maybe temple . Anytime . Temple of the Sun I would suggest . (--) . Well but there's a bunch right here too . But we only need one of these right? . Ok Temple of the Sun's fine . Ok . That would be my suggestion and cause I could swim to either of those . Yeah . Ok . Ok . Ok . (--) sorry thank you . If needed . So we'll take, ok so that's one move . Ah that's one, Ok so I have this, now I want to (--) my where am I red? . Do you want to go up and shore up? . Yeah . One of those or somethin' . Yeah .  yeah . One . Two . No it's . Two three . So . Well . Well if you take one you take one to here and then . Do I want to shore that up? . The third one would be to shore that up . (--) . Ok . Oh right cause I was gonna say ok yeah .

Ok . three floods . three flood card . Tidal Palace . Right here . Mmm . Um Copper Gate . Right here . And Crimson Forest . (--) right here . Ok . See . Alright . So now . My turn . Yes . Right I'm going to you . Give you one of these . Ok (--) . (--) . And should I . Move somewhere or just shore these up in the meantime? . Shore them . Probably shore them up . Then . Two and three . Ok then these two . Sorry guys, sorry guys . Oh boy . Well it's still the same level though I (--) just a (--) . Ok alright yeah . Ah . Ah . I'll do it again . And shuffle these with my . Problem, problem now is your shuffling cards that if you pick it (--) sink one you know . Right right . Yeah . Both fortunate, it looks like we're goin' tto enough of them that . Unless it unle, unle . Unless we cheat and stick 'em on the bottom right there, but they're wathing us well everybody's watching us . Right . They are wathin' that you know they've got video you know they could . Get the whole ah replay footage of that, so three here . Ah . Crimson Forest just like you said . Right . Temple of the Moon . Oh ok I'll take the Crimson Forest . Oh ok . (--) . That's fine let me flip that over . And Tidal Palace . Is also gone . Ah goes away . Don't . Oh ok . Ok and end of my turn . Hmm . End of my turn so . I'm gonna take . The Griffin or whatever this is for my turn . Yup . Hmm . Take one . That's one . Then you can fly . I can fly . What do we need to do where what . Well we're close to the . So these things . Ok so that's . Saw . Here . mmhmm . uhhuh . You're red to, ok that's two . Yeah . Because we have two of them now . Two . And . I don't have to take a third turn oh but i could shore, oh but that's diagonal . Or . No unless you ended up . Mmm . Flying to Breaker's . Flying . to yeah . Oh fly oh ok I'll fly . that's three . well that's three move . well . no you like . when that . Oh ok, flew, flew directly there so that was two . Yeah . And then there I'll shore (--) that's alright go ahead . ta . Perfect . Ok . I'll take two of those . One . two, take two of those . Copper Gate . Copper gate . is gone . Breaker's Bridge . Everything's good so we're just flippin' now . Ahh . Hmmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . How come mine always gets chosen? . And Temple of the Sun, right here . Ok (--) . ALright . Ok . So that was your turn right . Right? . Yes . So you need one of those back . Do you . So . Ok . Why . Oh right we did the flood thing so . yeah . I want to flip this . I'd sugges yeah . One . you could give him . (--) . card for no particular reason .  There's I mean yeah there's nothing you'd need to right . No, no so you can just move . Um . But you should stay on the fire on if that's where we're trying to get here . But she doesn't have to move do anything either . Right, right . Yeah the only thing in . In order to collect the fire I'd have to be on it . Yes . Oh ok . So you don't have to do anything . So there's really no reason to move for any reason . Yeah . Um . Ok . Um so two treasure . Of course naturally . ta . Yeah! . So . We have to get rid of . One . One, well we already have that so I'd suggest gettin rid of the, I don't know why .  That makes no sense .  That makes no sense .  I don't know why . Yeah . (--) . Oh . Ok . Right, right, right . Uh huh . Um . Three flood cards . three flood cards yeah . (--) . Lost Lagoon . (--) . Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate . Ok . Ok . And then that's set correct? . Right . Right . Ok so I'm not gonna give you anything you're all set with that . flip this . You can yeah shore two up right? . And this . And I will start making my way towards Fool's Landing . Ok . I have two Helicopter Lifts (--) . Oh good . And I have useless cards . As well as Sandbags if we needed for any reason .  So that's it I'll take three here . (--) . Cave of Shadows . Not worth standing on it . No . Bronze Gate . Send it there . Ok . And Cave of Embers up here . Ok . Alright . We have ok so we need to watch out for the . (--) . fire thing . Ok . Right . ta . Here . So . My turn . You probably want to flip over . Yeah . I'm gonna shore this, shore this up first would be one . Yeah . Um . Then I would almost think start getting ready ta . except we need, oh she has those ok . So . I'm blue . So I can move . (--) . And then two of them for my third move . Right? . Hmm . Ok and then I take two of these . Yeah or I mean versus just flying there .  I mean either one .  Yeah it doesn't matter . Well but either way . Ok I have . this . and this is the . (--) or anyone . Right . So that's five cards there .  Ok . Ok well . That's ok . Cause I need three flood cards . Howling Garden, why do you keep asking for them . Well I have to . Oh . Howling Garden, Misty Marsh . But it here . Ok and Watchtower . Right here . Ok . Ok . Then you're all set . Yup . Mmhmm . Um . So yeah yeah . (--) four . Yay! . Um so then . So guess what . Guess what? . Ah . I have these two . Right so . So you're gonna fly both of us over? . We'll fly both of you to that landing . And off . And of . Yeah . There we go . Oh look at that . (--) . Oh . I'd say that's a little big better huh? . Yeah .

I can't doing anything yet either.Cause you can always just fly me down there to save that when she gives me all of them.And I can hop on that one and save that one when it becomes my turn so.Right.Mmhmm..Ok.I'll take two please.Alright so we did not get lucky.Cool.(--).(--).Ok.No, no no.two.Do you wanna.Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate.K.Oops it moved on the board. Temple of the Moon is this one..Mmm.Um.(--).I don't want to lose, ahh.I know.Ok so is she done?.Yeah to you.Yeah.Um.Ok Engineer's turn.Ok so.Should she go.So Engineer.up to Temple of the Moon and flood that or should she just go ahead and do Breaker's Bridge?.Well Temple of the Moon's more valuable..Well we have the Treasure on that one now..But we still have that, Temple of the Sun up there..Yeah.That's not a huge deal, I'd rather see.See I, you can't distribute anything right now cause you don't know who's gonna get it.The chalices.That's true.Well if I go here (--) a bunch of pieces to know whether I'll be stuck next.(--).Right.What do you think you want to go after? Any of these?.Yeah what do you guys think we should do?.I think I'm just gonna go over this blue green one. Yeah.And.You're gonna go after it.I was gonna tyr to save the red one..Well then you shoudl give.Should give you should move to cliffs.Give her that.of Abandon and give her the chalice.Oh.of abandon.Now and you can give her the chalice.She has two other (--) cause she's gonna give me that.Ok.Ok.Yeah.Ok and then I could go here and save the piece.Ah.And then you can move here.And.Ok.And because she can only save that piece.Cause she's beside it.Right? So she'll save that piece.Or yeah it could save.No that's already.Wait, no move, move here and then, then.No she gave.Ok and then I could save it.One, two, three.What, no you'll need it it's just adjacent you don't need to move anywhere.But I have up to three turns.Oh.(--).So but I could flip it over right?.Well I was saying if she was on there, couldn't she.I think that's four. That's four if you ry to save that then.Grab your other car.She only, what'd you even move? Where were you originally?.There was like.(--) right here..Here.She want from here to here..And that's one but then she gave one to her that's two..Two.Two three ok.And that's three to move there so she can't do anything else.Ok.Ok.That's what I was trying to say like I.oh it doesnt' really matter.Two.Mmm.Two more let's hope you get a red.Ok.I only had two moves cause wasn't I liek right here (-) ok yeah..And we are moving up.You were here.But then you saved.Yeah that's (--).You moved and gave, giving a card to someone.Yeah ok that's right.Right it's a move, right it's an action.It's an action.This is a water rise card (unfortunately).Ok we moved the water rise already up.Yeah.Ah we might lose.I remem, ok..Hey.Ok so we'll (--).And give that back to you yeah.We might lose Temple of the Moon.That's ok.It seems ot be my (--).Sh, sh, sh.No, no, no, no.It's not (--).It's a game.It's merely statistics.Yeah.Look at that.LEt's just hope we don't lose this one, cause we might.I know.It's to early to be.I know.Losing one of them.and then three.Yup.Oh please not Temple of the Moon.Yeah three.Cliffs of Abandon.Ok.(--).Whispering Garden.I don't know where that is..(--).What else?.And Lost Lagoon.(--).Ok well we gotta be careful now we can't lose this either.Ok.Yeah I know.Ah.Ok.Ok so that ended up Engineer's turn.Yep soo.No I'm sure.Messenger's turn.Um.should I.So.should.I think you should give that.to me. I'll get rid of one of these use your Sandbags to save this just in case cause we can't.end up losing all these.that doesn't count as an action.So it doesn't.No.count if you get rid of that.ok so.You can't lose one of these treasures.right so.so I'll get rid of.Sandbags and save.So I'm gonna flip it over cause she's chosen the same as.I don't know.I I.No.You know what I mean like I.I, cause I'm closest to give this to her.Right you go ahead with one of those. Because we got three of them , we got three of them anyhow out.We're gonna have to get that back though.You're holding (--) helicopter lifts that's another thing right now.Right.We're gonna have to use them when we get to your turn.right.So.You still have one more.Mmm, so.you are.where are you?.I'm good, I'm good. I'm on Cliffs of Abandon, should s.Ok.ok.should I.Should I save it?.I don't.Yeah.Since I'm there.Does it really matter?.Wait.Can I move her?.Not until your turn.No you can't.What.Ok my turn ok.Use those on your turn.(--) you can. It doesn't really matter if we lose it.Um I just don't want you to get far away from this cause you're gonna eventually do that.Yeah.Um cause this is so this will cost you a whole turn to get over there unless she moves you.I'm.I'm just going to.do it just to do it.Yeah I mean this whole game is a matter of defense. We're defending against losing importat tiles.Thank you.dead.Yeah agree.Mmm.Ok.Yeah.So I got a Sandbags and I got one of.yeah.these.Ooo, ok that's next time around.cool.Good stuff.Ok.I'll get this finish that one up.And then I flip three of them.Where?.And I get Iron Gate.Cool.So we lose this.K.Yup.Um.Temple of the Moon.Temple of the Moon, of course.Ah shoot.That's ok. You could and get that one.And breaking.(--).Hmm.Breaker's.ohh.Breaker's Bridge.Ok who's blue?.Ah me so.Um.Do you want to move up,down or sideways?.I'll flip.I'll, I'll take it over here.I want to move right here.Yeah.She wants to move to Coral Palace.Well I'm gonna move her piece (--) do that anymore..Yup.exactly.Yeah yeah cause now you can fly both of them in case you needed to..Ok.Ah.Ah ok.Cool.Ok now.One move I would like you to do.I'd like to Helicopter you.Mmm.To Temple of the Moon.To Temple ok to the Sun.The Sun.Ok.I'll get that next turn.And.ch, ch, ch, ch.Well.Wait who needs.Ok who, she needs.I do.I'm with.I'm.You actually don't need to do that.I'm with her.Should.So.I'm with the Engineer, so I can now give the Engineer this piece..(--).Yeah..So the Engineer has three of those.Just is it a flying.Thank God and I only have four so I'm not gonna get rid of them.Instead of flying me to here, just fly me here..Thank you.Cause she needs.Oh no she only has three.Alright.I can give her my fourth one.right so.And.fly you there.I'll just.I'll just fly here.Alright, fly you there.(--).I flew you there instead of there.That's probably all you need to do.I gave her my piece so that's two.That.that.Mommmm, that sounds good.Thank you.So now I have one more move.That's it.Do you want to save something? Where are you at?.Want to save something?.Ok um.I don't.I think we're all good.(--).Yeah you don't really need to do anything.This next, this next turn of mine I'm gonna move and give her this.I don't see anything.Well.Thank you.She'll get that.Ah that piece will be off the board.And then I have five (--) so I better get (--).Cause she needs.And then I'll give you this.She'll just move her and take it.And I'll take that.Cause I can move one, two.Yeah.And then once you give it me I'll just do one, two, take.done.Yeah.Ok.And then we just need to worry about getting some of these.right.Yeah.Yeah and we need to start.Right.So I might actually.I go one too and it can work to her.Oh you're on, you're with me right?.I'll give you this on my turn too.ALright.And I'll give you mine since you gave me yours.Ok.I'll get these two.I also have two of these.Well wait I have one more move.And then she can give it to.We don't really need it though.Ok.So.But.But.You need it.But.I don't want you to move away from me.Ok you don't want ok.Yeah no cause if you do, cause like my turn i'm gonna give you this and then give this to her.Right, right, ok..Cause I was thinking being here but.I need to be with you for that.Yeah cause you can just fly whenever.Yeah.Ok.And she has Sandbags to save one of them.Ok so then this.Whatchyou got.Ok.Ok.Oh well.(--).You can.Give that to me on your turn.Ok.Because I have two of these.Ok yeah we're going to (--).three.We're gonna get these really fast now cause I'm gonna.Op.Can I have two?.three.Copper Gate.Ok.Ok.Crimson Forest.Crimson Forest.(--).And oh wait.Close.hmm.(--).Howling Garden, ok..Yeah be careful with that one we don't want to but this one's closer to her anyway..Yeah (--).Right.Yeah.Right.Alright my turn. Right guys? You take that.Right.Yes..You take that so now on you turn you're gonna get that.Cool.Cool.And then I'm going to.Thank you.I want to go.Ah nnnn, I guess I should move I don't think I have to move.Umm.Ah it's pretty irrelevant if I move or not.You now you don't want to move.But (--).Because.She can't give you that. Oh right she's.No she's so she can give it to whenever.So it doesn't really matter if I move.But statisically speaking if I'm here.In case I need to save something, it would be better if I was.it took me one less move to get to Temple of the Sun.Ok.Right.So am going to indeed move to here..Ok.Which is where yo're going to right now and get your.Ok.Yeah that makes.No, no, no (--).Right.That makes sense, oh wait wait, sorry.Ok.Wait stop stop.Oh.And we had to fiish this part first.Yeah.(--).Cause I got Water's Rise like I expected..Yeah that's true.So.(--).No (--) shuffle the (--).Ok so.Yeah we just don't want to lose Howling Garden's too easily.Yeah that's true.There's nothing I can do about that now.But we still have (--).Yeah.Yeah that's true to.It's closer to her anyway. She can't fly herself up there.(--).I can't.Alright three.Hmm.Ok so Howling Garden's gone.Cliffs of Abandon is.sinking not sunk.Crimson Forest is gone..Oh my turn's coming up and I'm gonna go save it so I dont' think.Yup.So you're good to go right now.Ok guys I could use some advice. Cause like you said we gotta be careful. Do you want me to go.Um I want you.to give her.Yes, that was one of the things I had wanted to do, so I have two moves on it.Mm yes I get that.That.Then move.Here.Hmm.Ok.You.Take that.Do you need to get rid of something?.Ok.Yeah.Um.Yes I do and I'm gonna.Ok so I'm gonna go here.Don't get rid of that, I already have two.And.this.Take this.this one.She's gonna give that to me.right.and I still.Sorry.still my turn.so that one, two.You can always save one.Well I have a third turn so what do you guys want me to do.Yeah.Um.Well since you already moved.probably just.maybe move I.over there.No cause I'm, I'm mixed between like if we start working our way here so when we win.Um but also.well she has to.collect the piece before she can move.I already did. I got it..She just did.ok.So she moved once and she gave you.moved once and took it so you're done..that's three.yeah.yeah that's three.right.Ok it's her turn..Good we have one..Ok.But I didn't get my turn (--).Treasure cards.Cause now what's cool is you might be able to give us something..Ok.(--).Hey look, look look, Helicopter.Yeah what else do you got?.And the (--).So I could give it to her I know.She's gonna need that.Next turn.That's why I'm excited cause I got two (--).Right.You get that to me, I get that.Then enxt turn she gives that.Ok now three.Yeah.That's game.That works.Yeah , Lost Lagoon, we lost that.three floods.Ok.It's ok.Can I get a Helicopter (--).Ah Copper Gate, we lost that.Lost Copper Gate.(NBgE).I don't (--).And Whispering Garden.Which is here.Ok.That ok, you're turn.And we got.It's gotta, you gotta we gotta save that, if we lose that..Ok.Um.We keep our options open here..We can't lose that.Um.(--).So do you want me to move to it?.Well technically we can.We can.Oh there it is..Because we only need three pieces..But your.But your really close. You're gonna get that, cause she's gonna give that to you..Yeah.Yeah I'm just gonna do that on my next turn.It's gonna be.this.Um yours.And that's it, cause that's three she has one.K.So your.Yeah I only got one but.You want to use.I already got my treasure so.that to me.Sandbag doesn't count.so.Want to use Sandbag or do you want to just do your shore up cause it's next to you anyway?.Sure.Oh.I'll just use Sandbags since it doesn;t count.And then shore up yours.Cool.Yeah.Just so you don't have to move.That's also, that's a good idea.ok.So now we're bufferred not to lose that.Cool.And then you're only one two away. I'm one away. Ok we're we stay over here..Ok.Ok.I need to move.You.Go ahead..You give me your thing I had.Well first.Oh that's perfect.Ok so now we have two options.Oh.Now I have four now.Cool.Right.So just in case we don't have to, just in case something happens with you.Ok.Now we gotta.K.Right.Now three of those.Three of those.Ok.Yeah um.I like having options.(--).Dunes of Deception.Mmhmm yes.Silver Gate.And Cave of Embers.Cave of Embers, ok.Oh.It's ok.You don't need this anymore.Oh no that's not important, that's not important.Ok.No it isn't.So.Now.Cool.Nice.Where are you? You are here.(--).I am.I'm right here, so my next turn I'll move to here, grab that.Well wait.And.All that your.I can move her there.But I can't collect it yet.You're gonna move her, well she can move herself there.Ok right.So your most important thing is to fly yourself.Where are you.What color are you? You're gray.I'm red, I'm right here..Um.So here, that's the problem, she has to give you that last gold one..I know I (--).um.What.So you can just.Hmm.Unless.(--).Get it from her and then also fly to.Right, I can.Yeah.Get it from her and then fly there.Does that.yeah that makes sense.As a pilot I can move.I can fly anywhere so flow.That's.Flew here for.true.You can just choose it.One, one thing.Or we just move there yeah.Yeah.Right.And then I get.She can't give it to you until her turn though, that's the problem..I can't yeah I know.Do you know what I mean? She can't trade things until it's her turn..But I can get it.From her because I'm in the same block as her.No.No she can only give you something and it's an action of hers, not yours.I don't think that's (--).Ok.Plus why would.Oh.Just to.question, why would she need to get it if.We have three because I already got four of this.It's not gonna, it's not gonna matter um.It's not gonna matter.I think the biggest deal.is.for us to kind of stay together so you can come to us and bring us all to Fool's Landing.Yeah I agree.Right, ok.Right, ok so.Yeah.Cause she's got a Helicopter card and so do I (--).Eventually.(--) that's the end of mine.(--).Pretty much cause like.Pretty much the end of mine.You don't want to lose.No.This don't.Right.Ah.Well did you use.Sink.No cause I, as pilot, I get to go wherever I want.So we're not, ok and we're definitely not worried about yours?.So.Right.Right.Oh.Um.And we don't have to worry about this because she has all four and you have all four.And all she has to do is move, move here and take that.I (--) get my treasures though.Ok.I move.Ok.to there take that, that's three.And then you have a Helicopter Lift to save us all at the end.Ok.Ok.So do I.Right and she, we have two Helicopter Lifts Ok.Yeah.I got one to..Cool, excellent.And I got.One, two, three.Yeah.Ok.So worst case scenario.We are buffered in all directions now.Right.There you go.And then.I need to get rid of one of these too.Good stuff.Um.No I have.No that's three.You have five, this counts as one.Ah that counts as one.(--).No.What'd we lose?.Oh Coral.Coral Palace.Coral Palace?.Ok it's right here.SO it's.Tid, Tidal Palace.Oh.Oh ok.Tidal palace.Palace, Bronze Gate.Bronze.Bronze Gate.Oh.Yeah, not Tidal Palalce Coral.Oh it is Tidal Palace.Yeah both, both.Oh.Ok.Turn both and.aahhh.Bronze Gate, do we.Yeah I just.That's not.Ok I'll turn it over (--).Ok we have to be really careful with this now too.Ok.Yeah we're (--).Ok.Ah ok my turn.Ok.Cool.I'm just gonna move.One.Gather that.So this guy.And then I'm going to.So that's.to.move.Thank you.Yeah.Right you can go diagonal.Well ok wait let me think about it.(--) think about it.Cause eventually you're gonna use.Ah.You want to get.She can't move herself.towards the landing..Yeah we get to Fool's Landing cause eventually you're gonna use.Yeah.Right.You or her are gonna use that.I know.Probably.Probably you cause.hopefully by the time she gets that.we can all get over here.Yeah.Yeah.Right.You're gray so one.gather.Fool's Landing..Ok.And then.You all you need to do is.Fly youself to Fool's Landing and take us all so I'm gonna move.Oh but I can't get there is one turn (--).That stinks.Get back in with them cause I can.go.we can't.You can only fly yourself.This you can fly all of us but we need this.But I have one two, but I could fly you.But she had yeah.at this point.Yeah but.You're.Like we gonna be splitting up for just one second because she's gonan have to go get that.Yeah.Ok.Oh k.You know what I mean.Right.Yeah that makes sense.Well let's see what happens with this, I don't.Ok.Ok.There's not really a perfect option here.(--).Ok.Ah just don't be Water's Rise.Ok, that's fine.Ok.And then (--).Yeah go ahead.And it's Watchtower, Misty something.Temple of the Sun ok.Alright.So Temple of the Sun.(--) to you.Temple of the Sun.Cool.Misty March.(--).Misty march.And Watchtower.That's here.Ok.Where is Watchtower.We're here.(--).Ok.That's ok.Ok.So we don't lose anything.Um.Ok.Red.This is (--).One of my actions is gonna be.What?.No, no, no you don't need to do that. That doesn't need to happen..No, don't need to do that anymore..Oh.um.Oh ok.Cause I got these.Ahh.Oh ok.You should just save everything around you.Yeah I agree and I got three turns so.Yeah.Right.I can do up to two of them cause I'm the Engineer so.Ah.Yeah.So this needs saved.Ok well I'm gonna listen to what he has to say.Well, hold on.You.You need to get to, where you at.I need to get to Coral Palace.I actually kind of want Watchtower to get destroyed cause then I can move in (--) here and we'll be where we need to be.Right.We both have Helicopter Lifts so.So we need.Um.We can't lose this so you need to save that cause that's where she has to go.No.Sure.Right.Ok.Yeah we're.So just save like.Ah.That's right (--).I guess these two.Yeah that's what I was gonna say.save.save those two..Ok.That's one..Um and then all you need to do is move yourself to here.Well I have a Helicopter, wait, so wait..That was one turn and then I go to the.It's blue..I'm confused.One, two, so that would be three turns.oh yeah.And then I would just, and then I'd just stay there just have (--).Right.Right.Yeah if we need it.Um.Yeah (--) and I need two treasure cards please..Right.Ok.Yeah.Can you pass (--) to me please?.Yeah.Ok guys, I got bad news.I have a Helicopter Lift again but.Yeah ok.That's ok.I got a Water Rise, so.Ok.Ok.Don't worry about it.I'm sorry.And.It's again very unlikely for us to lose..So it will be fine..Get there and move there.I think we're gonna be ok (--).Biggest deal, I want Watchtower gone so I can move instantly here.Yeah.Right.Yeah.Cause then you can get your piece and then on her turn she'll fly herself here.(--).Then we're all gone.Ok.That's this one.So one is Bronze Gate.Two is Cliffs of Abandon.Ok.And three is Whispering Garden.Ok I thought that was all.Oh ok whatever.Ok I'll take Bronze Gate.The other ones stay over there..Thank you.Ok.ta.Now your turn.(--).Sorry.Um so I'm going to move here.Ta.take it.take it and then move there.then move here.Ok we're ready to win now.And we get three Helicopter Lifts because (--).Let's.Ok.And then two of these.Two of these.Whatever.And then.Three of those.Three of them, Coral Palace,.Watchtower, come on Watchtower.Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate.Ah whatever..Ok.Could have made it easier..I know..(--) on her turn but now we can't. We have to wait till hers..No.What else.Coral Palace.Yeah. I think you (--).Ok.Take your other one already?.Um I think you were (--) I'm pretty sure so.I thought you got Coral Palace.I got Silver Gate.Oh it's right here.So.Oh now it's there (--).There it is.(--).I'll take those two.Silver Gate.Ok (--).No not Coral Palace.Oh.Ok.Ok.Ok now I can fly to there, to Whispering Garden..Well we don't you don't need to.Would have three out of four. Yeah..Oh we already have three, duh.All you really need to do.Yeah.ok.Um.Honestly, you just fly yourself here.Yeah.(--).Because the only thing I need to do now is I need to get.I need to get to here. Can we trade?.Right.I, I don't think we can trade that thing..I wish we could..I don't think you can trade that I wish you could cause you could give it to me and I could use it.Yeah I wish, I wish we could.Ah trade, trade, trade. Give a single card.Eee, what's it say.It doesn't really say much about it.there unfortunate.I think if you were on the same tile you can.Does it.Yeah that would have been my move.Yeah well we can still do it just.Just.Go back.Instead of me moving there.Does it.Moving here.And give that me?.Yeah I think so.I guess I don't see anything unusual.Right.Instead of me moving to there, I move here with you.Oh you may not give special action cards.But I moved from here, to here with you.it says it there..You can't.And then I can.Yeah you can't get special actions cards, oh..Then I can move.Fly us all there.Fly us all there.That's acutally that's a good idea becuase.Cool.Now we're all safe and she can move us out..And I get two Helicopter.Ok.Yeah.Guess what I'm (--).Not yet.BUt now we.Yeah.I know I.On my turn.Ok.Ok so.S.(they're all gone).Doesn't matter.Um.As long as it can (--) just as long as Fool's Landing doesn't get taken.(--).Right.Water Rise on my turn, then it's gone again and we don't lose..Ok.Ok.Temple of the Sun and Tidal Palace.You have one more.Oh.Visit.(--) palace.Misty whatever.Ok.Misty marsh.Alright, we win.

I'll get rid of one of these use your Sandbags to save this just in case cause we can't.end up losing all these.that doesn't count as an action.So it doesn't.No.count if you get rid of that.ok so.You can't lose one of these treasures.right so.so I'll get rid of.Sandbags and save.So I'm gonna flip it over cause she's chosen the same as.I don't know.I I.No.You know what I mean like I.I, cause I'm closest to give this to her.Right you go ahead with one of those.

Where are you at?.Want to save something?.Ok um.I don't.I think we're all good.(--).Yeah you don't really need to do anything.This next, this next turn of mine I'm gonna move and give her this.I don't see anything.Well.Thank you.She'll get that.Ah that piece will be off the board.And then I have five (--) so I better get (--).Cause she needs.And then I'll give you this.She'll just move her and take it.And I'll take that.Cause I can move one, two.Yeah.And then once you give it me I'll just do one, two, take.done.Yeah.Ok.And then we just need to worry about getting some of these.right.Yeah.Yeah and we need to start.Right.So I might actually.I go one too and it can work to her.Oh you're on, you're with me right?.I'll give you this on my turn too.ALright.And I'll give you mine since you gave me yours.Ok.I'll get these two.I also have two of these.Well wait I have one more move.And then she can give it to.We don't really need it though.Ok.So.But.But.You need it.But.I don't want you to move away from me.Ok you don't want ok.Yeah no cause if you do, cause like my turn i'm gonna give you this and then give this to her.Right, right, ok.Cause I was thinking being here but.I need to be with you for that.Yeah cause you can just fly whenever.Yeah.Ok.And she has Sandbags to save one of them.Ok so then this.Whatchyou got.Ok.Ok.Oh well.(--).You can.Give that to me on your turn.Ok.Because I have two of these.Ok yeah we're going to (--).three.We're gonna get these really fast now cause I'm gonna.Op.Can I have two?.three.Copper Gate.Ok.Ok.Crimson Forest.Crimson Forest.(--).And oh wait.Close.hmm.(--).Howling Garden, ok.Yeah be careful with that one we don't want to but this one's closer to her anyway.Yeah (--).Right.Yeah.Right.Alright my turn. Right guys? You take that.Right.Yes.You take that so now on you turn you're gonna get that.Cool.Cool.And then I'm going to.Thank you.I want to go.Ah nnnn, I guess I should move I don't think I have to move.Umm.Ah it's pretty irrelevant if I move or not.You now you don't want to move.But (--).Because.She can't give you that. Oh right she's.No she's so she can give it to whenever.So it doesn't really matter if I move.But statisically speaking if I'm here.In case I need to save something, it would be better if I was.it took me one less move to get to Temple of the Sun.Ok.Right.So am going to indeed move to here.Ok.Which is where yo're going to right now and get your.Ok.Yeah that makes.No, no, no (--).Right.That makes sense, oh wait wait, sorry.Ok.Wait stop stop.Oh.And we had to fiish this part first.Yeah.(--).Cause I got Water's Rise like I expected.Yeah that's true.So.(--).No (--) shuffle the (--).Ok so.Yeah we just don't want to lose Howling Garden's too easily.Yeah that's true.There's nothing I can do about that now.But we still have (--).Yeah.Yeah that's true to.It's closer to her anyway. She can't fly herself up there.(--).I can't.Alright three.Hmm.Ok so Howling Garden's gone.Cliffs of Abandon is.sinking not sunk.Crimson Forest is gone.Oh my turn's coming up and I'm gonna go save it so I dont' think.Yup.So you're good to go right now.Ok guys I could use some advice. Cause like you said we gotta be careful. Do you want me to go.Um I want you.to give her.Yes, that was one of the things I had wanted to do, so I have two moves on it.Mm yes I get that.That.Then move.Here.Hmm.Ok.You.Take that.Do you need to get rid of something?.Ok.Yeah.Um.Yes I do and I'm gonna.Ok so I'm gonna go here.Don't get rid of that, I already have two.And.this.Take this.this one.She's gonna give that to me.right.and I still.Sorry.still my turn.so that one, two.You can always save one.Well I have a third turn so what do you guys want me to do.Yeah.Um.Well since you already moved.probably just.maybe move I.over there.No cause I'm, I'm mixed between like if we start working our way here so when we win.Um but also.well she has to.collect the piece before she can move.I already did. I got it.She just did.ok.So she moved once and she gave you.moved once and took it so you're done.that's three.yeah.yeah that's three.right.Ok it's her turn.Good we have one.Ok.But I didn't get my turn (--).Treasure cards.Cause now what's cool is you might be able to give us something.Ok.(--).Hey look, look look, Helicopter.Yeah what else do you got?.And the (--).So I could give it to her I know.She's gonna need that.Next turn.That's why I'm excited cause I got two (--).Right.You get that to me, I get that.Then enxt turn she gives that.Ok now three.Yeah.That's game.That works.Yeah , Lost Lagoon, we lost that.three floods.Ok.It's ok.Can I get a Helicopter (--).Ah Copper Gate, we lost that.Lost Copper Gate.(NBgE).I don't (--).And Whispering Garden.Which is here.Ok.That ok, you're turn.And we got.It's gotta, you gotta we gotta save that, if we lose that.Ok.Um.We keep our options open here.We can't lose that.Um.(--).So do you want me to move to it?.Well technically we can.We can.Oh there it is.Because we only need three pieces.But your.But your really close. You're gonna get that, cause she's gonna give that to you.Yeah.Yeah I'm just gonna do that on my next turn.It's gonna be.this.Um yours.And that's it, cause that's three she has one.K.So your.Yeah I only got one but.You want to use.I already got my treasure so.that to me.Sandbag doesn't count.so.Want to use Sandbag or do you want to just do your shore up cause it's next to you anyway?.Sure.Oh.I'll just use Sandbags since it doesn;t count.And then shore up yours.Cool.Yeah.Just so you don't have to move.That's also, that's a good idea.ok.So now we're bufferred not to lose that.Cool.And then you're only one two away. I'm one away. Ok we're we stay over here.Ok.Ok.I need to move.You.Go ahead.You give me your thing I had.Well first.Oh that's perfect.Ok so now we have two options.Oh.Now I have four now.Cool.Right.So just in case we don't have to, just in case something happens with you.Ok.Now we gotta.K.Right.Now three of those.Three of those.Ok.Yeah um.I like having options.(--).Dunes of Deception.Mmhmm yes.Silver Gate.And Cave of Embers.Cave of Embers, ok.Oh.It's ok.You don't need this anymore.Oh no that's not important, that's not important.Ok.No it isn't.So.Now.Cool.Nice.Where are you? You are here.(--).I am.I'm right here, so my next turn I'll move to here, grab that.Well wait.And.All that your.I can move her there.But I can't collect it yet.You're gonna move her, well she can move herself there.Ok right.So your most important thing is to fly yourself.Where are you.What color are you? You're gray.I'm red, I'm right here.Um.So here, that's the problem, she has to give you that last gold one.I know I (--).um.What.So you can just.Hmm.Unless.(--).Get it from her and then also fly to.Right, I can.Yeah.Get it from her and then fly there.Does that.yeah that makes sense.As a pilot I can move.I can fly anywhere so flow.That's.Flew here for.true.You can just choose it.One, one thing.Or we just move there yeah.Yeah.Right.And then I get.She can't give it to you until her turn though, that's the problem.I can't yeah I know.Do you know what I mean? She can't trade things until it's her turn.But I can get it.From her because I'm in the same block as her.No.No she can only give you something and it's an action of hers, not yours.I don't think that's (--).Ok.Plus why would.Oh.Just to.question, why would she need to get it if.We have three because I already got four of this.It's not gonna, it's not gonna matter um.It's not gonna matter.I think the biggest deal.is.for us to kind of stay together so you can come to us and bring us all to Fool's Landing.Yeah I agree.Right, ok.Right, ok so.Yeah.Cause she's got a Helicopter card and so do I (--).Eventually.(--) that's the end of mine.(--).Pretty much cause like.Pretty much the end of mine.You don't want to lose.No.This don't.Right.Ah.Well did you use.Sink.No cause I, as pilot, I get to go wherever I want.So we're not, ok and we're definitely not worried about yours?.So.Right.Right.Oh.Um.And we don't have to worry about this because she has all four and you have all four.And all she has to do is move, move here and take that.I (--) get my treasures though.Ok.I move.Ok.to there take that, that's three.And then you have a Helicopter Lift to save us all at the end.Ok.Ok.So do I.Right and she, we have two Helicopter Lifts Ok.Yeah.I got one to.Cool, excellent.And I got.One, two, three.Yeah.Ok.So worst case scenario.We are buffered in all directions now.Right.There you go.And then.I need to get rid of one of these too.Good stuff.Um.No I have.No that's three.You have five, this counts as one.Ah that counts as one.(--).No.What'd we lose?.Oh Coral.Coral Palace.Coral Palace?.Ok it's right here.SO it's.Tid, Tidal Palace.Oh.Oh ok.Tidal palace.Palace, Bronze Gate.Bronze.Bronze Gate.Oh.Yeah, not Tidal Palalce Coral.Oh it is Tidal Palace.Yeah both, both.Oh.Ok.Turn both and.aahhh.Bronze Gate, do we.Yeah I just.That's not.Ok I'll turn it over (--).Ok we have to be really careful with this now too.Ok.Yeah we're (--).Ok.Ah ok my turn.Ok.Cool.I'm just gonna move.One.Gather that.So this guy.And then I'm going to.So that's.to.move.Thank you.Yeah.Right you can go diagonal.Well ok wait let me think about it.(--) think about it.Cause eventually you're gonna use.Ah.You want to get.She can't move herself.towards the landing.Yeah we get to Fool's Landing cause eventually you're gonna use.Yeah.Right.You or her are gonna use that.I know.Probably.Probably you cause.hopefully by the time she gets that.we can all get over here.Yeah.Yeah.Right.You're gray so one.gather.Fool's Landing.Ok.And then.You all you need to do is.Fly youself to Fool's Landing and take us all so I'm gonna move.Oh but I can't get there is one turn (--).That stinks.Get back in with them cause I can.go.we can't.You can only fly yourself.This you can fly all of us but we need this.But I have one two, but I could fly you.But she had yeah.at this point.Yeah but.You're.Like we gonna be splitting up for just one second because she's gonan have to go get that.Yeah.Ok.Oh k.You know what I mean.Right.Yeah that makes sense.Well let's see what happens with this, I don't.Ok.Ok.There's not really a perfect option here.(--).Ok.Ah just don't be Water's Rise.Ok, that's fine.Ok.And then (--).Yeah go ahead.And it's Watchtower, Misty something.Temple of the Sun ok.Alright.So Temple of the Sun.(--) to you.Temple of the Sun.Cool.Misty March.(--).Misty march.And Watchtower.That's here.Ok.Where is Watchtower.We're here.(--).Ok.That's ok.Ok.So we don't lose anything.Um.Ok.Red.This is (--).One of my actions is gonna be.What?.No, no, no you don't need to do that. That doesn't need to happen.No, don't need to do that anymore.Oh.um.Oh ok.Cause I got these.Ahh.Oh ok.You should just save everything around you.Yeah I agree and I got three turns so.Yeah.Right.I can do up to two of them cause I'm the Engineer so.Ah.Yeah.So this needs saved.Ok well I'm gonna listen to what he has to say.Well, hold on.You.You need to get to, where you at.I need to get to Coral Palace.I actually kind of want Watchtower to get destroyed cause then I can move in (--) here and we'll be where we need to be.Right.We both have Helicopter Lifts so.So we need.Um.We can't lose this so you need to save that cause that's where she has to go.No.Sure.Right.Ok.Yeah we're.So just save like.Ah.That's right (--).I guess these two.Yeah that's what I was gonna say.save.save those two.Ok.That's one.Um and then all you need to do is move yourself to here.Well I have a Helicopter, wait, so wait.That was one turn and then I go to the.It's blue.I'm confused.One, two, so that would be three turns.oh yeah.And then I would just, and then I'd just stay there just have (--).Right.Right.Yeah if we need it.Um.Yeah (--) and I need two treasure cards please.Right.Ok.Yeah.Can you pass (--) to me please?.Yeah.Ok guys, I got bad news.I have a Helicopter Lift again but.Yeah ok.That's ok.I got a Water Rise, so.Ok.Ok.Don't worry about it.I'm sorry.And.It's again very unlikely for us to lose.So it will be fine.Get there and move there.I think we're gonna be ok (--).Biggest deal, I want Watchtower gone so I can move instantly here.Yeah.Right.Yeah.Cause then you can get your piece and then on her turn she'll fly herself here.(--).Then we're all gone.Ok.That's this one.So one is Bronze Gate.Two is Cliffs of Abandon.Ok.And three is Whispering Garden.Ok I thought that was all.Oh ok whatever.Ok I'll take Bronze Gate.The other ones stay over there.Thank you.Ok.ta.Now your turn.(--).Sorry.Um so I'm going to move here.Ta.take it.take it and then move there.then move here.Ok we're ready to win now.And we get three Helicopter Lifts because (--).Let's.Ok.And then two of these.Two of these.Whatever.And then.Three of those.Three of them, Coral Palace,.Watchtower, come on Watchtower.Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate.Ah whatever.Ok.Could have made it easier.I know.(--) on her turn but now we can't. We have to wait till hers.No.What else.Coral Palace.Yeah. I think you (--).Ok.Take your other one already?.Um I think you were (--) I'm pretty sure so.I thought you got Coral Palace.I got Silver Gate.Oh it's right here.So.Oh now it's there (--).There it is.(--).I'll take those two.Silver Gate.Ok (--).No not Coral Palace.Oh.Ok.Ok.Ok now I can fly to there, to Whispering Garden.Well we don't you don't need to.Would have three out of four. Yeah.Oh we already have three, duh.All you really need to do.Yeah.ok.Um.Honestly, you just fly yourself here.Yeah.(--).Because the only thing I need to do now is I need to get.I need to get to here. Can we trade?.Right.I, I don't think we can trade that thing.I wish we could.I don't think you can trade that I wish you could cause you could give it to me and I could use it.Yeah I wish, I wish we could.Ah trade, trade, trade. Give a single card.Eee, what's it say.It doesn't really say much about it.there unfortunate.I think if you were on the same tile you can.Does it.Yeah that would have been my move.Yeah well we can still do it just.Just.Go back.Instead of me moving there.Does it.Moving here.And give that me?.Yeah I think so.I guess I don't see anything unusual.Right.Instead of me moving to there, I move here with you.Oh you may not give special action cards.But I moved from here, to here with you.it says it there.You can't.And then I can.Yeah you can't get special actions cards, oh.Then I can move.Fly us all there.Fly us all there.That's acutally that's a good idea becuase.Cool.Now we're all safe and she can move us out.And I get two Helicopter.Ok.Yeah.Guess what I'm (--).Not yet.BUt now we.Yeah.I know I.On my turn.Ok.Ok so.S.(they're all gone).Doesn't matter.Um.As long as it can (--) just as long as Fool's Landing doesn't get taken.(--).Right.Water Rise on my turn, then it's gone again and we don't lose.Ok.Ok.Temple of the Sun and Tidal Palace.You have one more.Oh.Visit.(--) palace.Misty whatever.Ok.Misty marsh.Alright, we win.

Oh.You got four.Yeah.Cave of Shadows, Observatory and Cave of Embers.We're alive.Fool's Landing might not even be in there.That's pretty funny.I think we probably (-_).What was the other one?.Observatory?.Oh ok.Ok.Observatory's gone.(--).Ok.And.Sss.Ah.What else did you say?

And what woudl you say like I can go up and.Mmhmm.Um.And shore it.You can go flip and.Well before you do that do you think.you should come down and give me.The fire card.cause you have that one even.Yeah and that way because.Mmhmm.And then you're close to here.Yeah.Yeah.I agree ok.So that's two.and then.I don't think there's really much, unless I want to like move here to make my trip up there easier if I have to go.Yeah cause where's the other one? oh it's way down there. Ok.Ok.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.Crimson Forest and Temple of the Sun.Ok.Mmm.Can you use the Sandbags, like at any time (--) cause it says you can use them at any time.Play at any time.Should.Does that count as an action?.Ok.Yeah.Do you.I'm not sure if it would be sm.Do you want to do like this one?.Ss.Smart well.Oh cause that one we have (--).That one we have, I was thinking that one.Yeah I as gonna say if you wanted to do that one because you're headed toward there anyway.Ok.Hmm.Cause it's closer than down there.Hmm.I'm like.(--).wondering if I should.Yeah.Yeah now you're right.We have to not wait.Because it's gotta be in the pile alreadu somewhere.Mmhmm.Yup.That's it.Mmhmm.Um.I.might head toward.Well actually, I can just.Well no cause that's only one.Yeah you only have one so.Um.(--).(--).(--).You were here? Ok.Yeah um.Maybe just like move and.I mean you could move here and flip this.Yeah I can move and shore up yeah.And you can.Well actually, I can move once, shore up, shore up, yeah.Mmhmm.Right.So more Helicopters.And.Chalice.And two (--).Ok so we've got Copper.and Tidal Palace.Yeah.(--).And.I should probably start moving that way.I have a chalice.You have a chalice and that I mean.You could always fly to me.Mmhmm.And give them to me next turn so.So you could just like walk.Yeah so I should probably just go flip.One two three.(--).I mean like yeah if you're here, these are next to eachother so it's really.easy.Yeah.I guess go down here and then.Get treasure cards.Ok.Oh great.Oh you have to discard.Oh one of them.You should discard the.Yeah.Earth one right?.Yeah.Well she kinda wants it but.Fire.Well.But I yeah cause I'm close to hear so probably.I would so that that's best, yeah.Yeah.Mmhmm.Good.I keep forgetting.to discard.Looks like Dunes of Deception.And Silver Gate.Hmm, ok.ta um so I'm on.well ok I was going to go up there I suppose.I was gonna cause I'm close to here to shore up that, but you could always do that .Hmm.So um.I guess I can start going up here.And I.I mean I could shore up these two while I'm here.It would be really good to give you one more exit route.that one doesn't really matter.So I want to do this one for shore.Yeah.Hmm.And then.You could always move up to Whispering Garden.Mmhmm.That way you're just already there.Ok.Yeah if you draw more your treasure card's free.Ok well.Water Rise.And.Three.Ok.So Temple of the Moon.Um.This one?.Breaker's Bridge.And Whispering Garden.So I'm glad I flipped that earlier.Mhmm.Ok I'm gonna shore up this guy.K.And.Um I'll move to you cause I'll give you that.And.Yup.And those are your three.Perfect.Thank you.Yup.And then on your next turn well I'm just asking like.I keep forgetting, can you move?.Mmhmm.Two of us?.Yeah.same tile.(--).So yeah.Ok.Um I will.Um I guess I'll just discard them.Ah.What was that one.Well I need to discard one so.We should probably.Maybe discard a Helicopter.Keep them yeah discard a Helicopter.and lose it later in the game.Mmhmm.Good.Ok.K and then.wait.Three floods.Ok so Dunes are done.Um.Silver Gate, that's also done.And Tidal which is flipped.Ok cool.K.So.First thing I want to do.You you're tyring to get that right?.Yeah so that's the first one I want to do.(--).ta.Ok.Um.Let's see.I could move up to here and then just.I mean you're at least close to everything else.Hmm.or should I go up.Oh I can't.I was gonna say go up two and then flip this but I can't.what are you gonna say?.Mmhmm usually.because yeah.Um.So I could either.Yeah I would just say.go here or up here.I would say go to here if you're gonna move cause.Mmhmm.You're close to both of these.Yeah and I can flip them next turn I have two.Hmm.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.Oh thank you.Yeah.(--).Three of these.I got three.Oh yeah because, ok.Crimson Forest.Ah.Oh it's done.Where's that?.Ok.Ok.Cool.ta.(--).Phanthom Rock.Done.Done.K.And Temple of the Sun.There.Ooo ok.Cool.So.Um.I need to.Shore this, I suppose.Yeah.Mmhmm.And then.It might be a good idea if you go down to me so I can give you this card on the next turn.Mmhmm.Right that'll be three.Because.if I move then I can't.Can you fly, you can fly to me and give me yours right?.Ah.And then you could fly us both up to here.Mmm.Yeah.I think so yeah.Could you do that in one?.Yeah ok great.Ok.Alright.Yeah.Ok Water's Rise and the Chalice.Ok Tidal palace.Sunk.And.That's ok we have that.Mmhmm.Yes ok Temple of the Moon.There we go.Is sunk.Mmm.Oh yeah.Not great.TEmple of the Sun is sunk to. Oh no!

Ok..No you're gonna shore it up cause you're already there..Ok.Nope..Yeah.Ok.Alright.Ok.Um..And what would we probably just keep you there. You already got two and I got one left.Well.But hang on, hang on wait a minute..Or alternate, alternately.Hmm.Um.If you think that's a good idea..I'm.close to the other one.and.shoot the Messenger is a much better idea.I like it.You like it?.I like it alot.What do you think?.Ok what yeah ok.So you're the Messenger, you can give her both of yours and that will count as a move.That's three.Ok.Right.That's not it, because then I could just give her one next turn.One action per card.You can even fly her over..One.Yeah when you catch me.Right um, when you've got five so that was.right.Is that two moves for you?.Yeah that made my third. Giving two cards away and flipping that up.Ok.Right yeah yeah.The reason that I shore that up is for kicks and giggles..Well she didn't she already shore this up?.I did.Yeah I already did shore it up. Mmhmm..Right, oh ok gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Gotcha..And then each card is a turn.Ok.Right each card is a turn gotcha.Alright.Right..Ok.Wait, if I could use this and then get another turn.Well I mean it's not like an important spot, I just thought because you were right there..Yeah.Well--.Yeah.Yeah there's not treasure icon there either..K.It's not like I.critical spot yeah so.yeah.I take my two.Mmhmm go ahead.Oh wait.Oh you didn't draw already.No you didn't draw yet.Oh I didn't?

Lost Lagoon was gone too..Mmhm..But it's fine..Whispering.What's Whispering Garden?.Right here..Ok we're gonna hold on to that one..Yeah.Oh ok..Give me Lost Lagoon and I'll trade you Whispering Garden..Oh ok..Great..There we go..Oh.Well.my turn?.Yeah.Mmhm..Oh boy so where am I? There you are..Weren't you gonna fly that over.I'll fly to you.Mmhm..How about I shore this up first?.Yeah, I was just thinking, let's keep at least one of those shored up..Yes. And then I'll fly to you and that's two, and then I'll give you this and that's three..Mmhm..And that's three..Ta da..And I have to discard one, so I'll do.Right let's get rid of the chalice, we're over it..This one..Great..And then you're gonna move there..We're just gonna move right there. One, two. Another Helicopter dude and a Lion dude..Ah what do you think I should discard? Got two lions we need one. We need a lion..(--) we have a Sandbag, cause we have a Sandbag..We've got three. We already, I have three of these though..We could.We're gonna need one..We could use one to move here without using.an action.Oh yeah.Mmhmm..Let's do it..Let's do it? Ok..Let's do it..Yeah..We're done..Yeah..I hate to see it wasted..Yeah..I would tend to agree..Ok..Ta.And.Cool..I don't know did you want to use a Sandbag to shore this up (--) a treasure icon or?.Do you want to save it?.I see no reason to hold on to it.Ok.personally..And that's a good call. Might as well keep it safe. Um okay can I have three of those guys..Mmm.No.Three of these. Two, three..Thank you..Temple of the Moon where green is..Mmhmm..Yeah.Ah Breaking Bridge is gone..Breaker's Bridge sorry, and Cliffs of Abandon is gone..There you go.Cool..Now Engineer..Mmhmm..Cashin' in..Cashin' in..Thank you..You got all of them..Mmhmm..Um, so that's one..Let's see what.You we need a Chalice and we need a Lion..I'm (--) with the Lion (--) up..Ok.Ah ok, or I can fly there, that's fine..Well.well she can give.cards.So she could give.Yes she can..her a lion.So you could make.right and I can just fly right to the lion..Yeah, yeah mmhmm..Yeah, so I'll make my way to chalice for the last two actions..Ok..Makes sense..Cause you're right by Fool's Landing anyway..Hmm..Oh good point..Cool..Cool..Alright..So two..One two..Two chalices..Nice..Oh nice..Yeah..What..What..I can.And three of these..And then.Let's see, Cave of Embers..What do you got?.Cave of Embers..Copper Gate..Copper Gate..And Howling Garden..And Howling Garden's right there..That's here..Ok..Ok so.Oh wait a minute, you done?.Yup, I'm good..We're all done..You're done? Ok..You get this. That's one..I get that, that's one..Mmhmm. Mmhmm..Let's.I should move out of there..That doesn't matter..Maybe just.Move.to Fool's Landing..Try to make your way there. Now we do have two of these flier guys and we only need one, so we could get you there that way too..Sure.Yeah um..Um.So if you have, well you have two moves left, so....So just stop then,.Well we can.to make sure you're not trapped..Right, how about we. Yeah.You could.Move here and then shore Copper Gate..That's a safe move..Hmm. (--) lose..And that would put, that has a chalice..Right..We'll have to keep you on Misty Marsh though..Right..Yeah..But you're way is still clear..Ok.Perfect. Oh boy.

Phantom Rock is gone.Mmhmm.(--).Thank you.And that's it for me.Ok um.Ta.(--).You where you at?.Right now.You're right there. You've got a chalice and a moon rock.I'm here.Yeah.Mmhmm.Um whatever you want to do.Um you can move to Lost Lagoon and shore it up.Should we give this?.Yeah.I mean.If you want.Maybe we can start.What's that guy?.Yo.It's a chalice.And then she'll have that.Oh cool.Ok.sure.Yeah.Sure.No reason not to.A.Mmhmm.Don't think.It's moving?.Don't you have to be--.Yeah you've gotta be by it.Mmm.Yeah.Right.Move by it.Mmhmm.Right.Yeah.So.If you were the Explorer.You don't have to do anything if you don't want, you cool? Alright. That's fine.(--).Yeah.Yeah.Ah you're good, ok.Yeah.That's two, I guess Sandbag.That's cool.That.Mmhmm.And then.Cool.Two of these.Mmhmm.Breaker's Bridge and Cliffs of Abandon.Ta.Breaker's Bridge and Cliffs of Abandon, where is what?.That's this.You got 'em.All near me.Cause I kept shoring them.Cool.Yeah.Ok.And we're cool.ta.Yeah.Now let's see.Don't have a lot to trade.Where am I at?.So how about?.I will go.Here.Shore this up.Mmhmm.And then I'll just go here.Because I have one so maybe if we get lucky in the next (--).That's fair.Fair.Cool.Eh.So we got two.We got a fire and another Helicopter Lift.Mmhmm.Can I have two of those please?.Ok.Thank you so much.Now we got Golden Gate.Ah ba, ba ba, ba down there and Whispering.Yeah.Gold.Garden which is right there.we're on it.Thank you very much.K.Fun.Hmm.Ok so it's my turn again.Mmhmm.So.I think I'll take my first action showing these two.(look out).my second action I'll.Move to the bridge.makes sense.And I'll finish out shoring these.makes sense.And then.Playin' it safe. I like it.And then I'll collect.Ok.Okay.Two.Mmhmm.Let's see and I have two.discard one.keep the fire.yeah.and.cause I've got one of those.get rid of the lion?.Alright.Um yeah (--).There you go.And two of those yeah.Yeah.We've got.Iron Gate.We've got Temple of the Moon.Iron Gate.Temple of the Moon.Alright.Cool.Mmhmm.Ok.Now.we can.I mean.you can move to Misty Marsh and shore up Temple of the Moon.which might make sense because you've got two of those.Yeah.Oh.Gotcha in possession. Get you set up.Yeah, mmhmm.Mmhmm. Mmhmm.Two and three, shore these up three.That's two.Yeah that would be.Yeah that would be three.Cool.Okay.Cool.So two.What do you got?.A tiger and a Water Rise. Ok. So, you need to.Hmm.(--).You're taking three.Right?.I'm good.(--) ok.(--) discard that right now.Mmhmm.Ok.Mmhmm.(--).And you'll lift this up.Pick two.Oh we shuffle these first.Okay.Let's see.Ok.And then.Two three.we draw three.Ok Cliffs of Abandon.Mmhm.Cliffs of Abandon.Mmhm.Whispering Garden and Lost Lagoon.Mmhmm.Whisp.(--) they're all right there.Mmhmm.Okay then I'm done.Cool.It was tough.Yeah.Yes.Um I will give this to you.So you can.Um.I thought the Messenger could only do that?.Oh yeah I keep forgetting that, I keep forgetting that, you're totally right.Cause yeah, cause we're not on.(--).Oh.Yeah.And then I'll give one to you.Thank you.And then I will.And I have to discard one so I guess.discard two.Discard one of these.What do you think?.I should just, I should probably shore up something.This one has a treasure icon on it.Might as well.Yeah.Draw that up for me please? Thank you.And that's three.And then you move there next.Um.Oh I'd move there.well I was actually thinking.(--) I gotta.I.Well yeah yeah you should go there. Cause she's got four of those guys.Yeah.Oh yeah and you collect your cards.Oh.I assume she said.So we got two and we have.Oh yeah this isn't like that. Oh ok.Ok.Right.Ok we got Sandbags, we got.and stone.Cool.Can I have three of those bad boys?.Mhm.Oh boy.And we got the new Golden Gate.Which goes away.Which goes away.And we got the Temple Moon right there.And the Iron Gate, which also goes away.Wow thank you.Ok.Mmhmm.Now.Now.You.can.can--.use the first two to move.Right.And then cash in.Yes you can.Thank you.Alright.Two.Mmhmm.Thank you.You've got.A stone and chalice.And we've got.Crimson Forest.Breaker's Bridge and Howling Garden.I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention.Call the other one?.Yeah.It's ah.Breaker's Bridge.And Crimson Forest.Howling Garden.(--) Garden.Ah bottom left corner.Howling Garden?.Yeah.Great.Ok.And that's it for me.See a.Now you.Let's see, what, what what do we have?.(--).Wait I can shore this up.You should yeah. You should shore that up. Well you can just shore it up cause you're already there. You can--.Yeah.I wouldn't use that, Yeah I would just use that.Mmmhmm. Mmhmm.You wouldn't use that? Ok.No you're gonna shore it up cause you're already there.Ok.Nope.Yeah.Ok.Alright.Ok.Um.And what would we probably just keep you there. You already got two and I got one left.Well.But hang on, hang on wait a minute.Or alternate, alternately.Hmm.Um.If you think that's a good idea.I'm.close to the other one.and.shoot the Messenger is a much better idea.I like it.You like it?.I like it alot.What do you think?.Ok what yeah ok.So you're the Messenger, you can give her both of yours and that will count as a move.That's three.Ok.Right.That's not it, because then I could just give her one next turn.One action per card.You can even fly her over.One.Yeah when you catch me.Right um, when you've got five so that was.right.Is that two moves for you?.Yeah that made my third. Giving two cards away and flipping that up.Ok.Right yeah yeah.The reason that I shore that up is for kicks and giggles.Well she didn't she already shore this up?.I did.Yeah I already did shore it up. Mmhmm.Right, oh ok gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Gotcha.And then each card is a turn.Ok.Right each card is a turn gotcha.Alright.Right.Ok.Wait, if I could use this and then get another turn.Well I mean it's not like an important spot, I just thought because you were right there.Yeah.Well--.Yeah.Yeah there's not treasure icon there either.K.It's not like I.critical spot yeah so.yeah.I take my two.Mmhmm go ahead.Oh wait.Oh you didn't draw already.No you didn't draw yet.Oh I didn't? I.Ok.No.Ah.Water's Rise again ok.Weeeee.and Fire.Alright.Oh boy.Ok so.So it's three.Yup.Yup and you shuffle the cards first.Shuffle these cards.That goes without these guys.Yeah.Yeah.yes.You're right there.Mmhmm.And then you pick three.Um.And where are you. Right there. Yeah.Two.Three, Crimson Forest.There you go.Whispering Garden.Crimson Forest is gone.That's ok.Whispering Garden.Oh can I have the Crimson Forest one.That's.Yeah and Lost Lagoon.Yeah that's this one.And Lost Lagoon, that's gone.Thank you. Lost Lagoon was gone too.Mmhm.But it's fine.Whispering.What's Whispering Garden?.Right here.Ok we're gonna hold on to that one.Yeah.Oh ok.Give me Lost Lagoon and I'll trade you Whispering Garden.Oh ok.Great.There we go.Oh.Well.my turn?.Yeah.Mmhm.Oh boy so where am I? There you are.Weren't you gonna fly that over.I'll fly to you.Mmhm.How about I shore this up first?.Yeah, I was just thinking, let's keep at least one of those shored up.Yes. And then I'll fly to you and that's two, and then I'll give you this and that's three.Mmhm.And that's three.Ta da.And I have to discard one, so I'll do.Right let's get rid of the chalice, we're over it.This one.Great.And then you're gonna move there.We're just gonna move right there. One, two. Another Helicopter dude and a Lion dude.Ah what do you think I should discard? Got two lions we need one. We need a lion.(--) we have a Sandbag, cause we have a Sandbag.We've got three. We already, I have three of these though.We could.We're gonna need one.We could use one to move here without using.an action.Oh yeah.Mmhmm.Let's do it.Let's do it? Ok.Let's do it.Yeah.We're done.Yeah.I hate to see it wasted.Yeah.I would tend to agree.Ok.Ta.And.Cool.I don't know did you want to use a Sandbag to shore this up (--) a treasure icon or?.Do you want to save it?.I see no reason to hold on to it.Ok.personally.And that's a good call. Might as well keep it safe. Um okay can I have three of those guys.Mmm.No.Three of these. Two, three.Thank you.Temple of the Moon where green is.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ah Breaking Bridge is gone.Breaker's Bridge sorry, and Cliffs of Abandon is gone.There you go.Cool.Now Engineer.Mmhmm.Cashin' in.Cashin' in.Thank you.You got all of them.Mmhmm.Um, so that's one.Let's see what.You we need a Chalice and we need a Lion.I'm (--) with the Lion (--) up.Ok.Ah ok, or I can fly there, that's fine.Well.well she can give.cards.So she could give.Yes she can.her a lion.So you could make.right and I can just fly right to the lion.Yeah, yeah mmhmm.Yeah, so I'll make my way to chalice for the last two actions.Ok.Makes sense.Cause you're right by Fool's Landing anyway.Hmm.Oh good point.Cool.Cool.Alright.So two.One two.Two chalices.Nice.Oh nice.Yeah.What.What.I can.And three of these.And then.Let's see, Cave of Embers.What do you got?.Cave of Embers.Copper Gate.Copper Gate.And Howling Garden.And Howling Garden's right there.That's here.Ok.Ok so.Oh wait a minute, you done?.Yup, I'm good.We're all done.You're done? Ok.You get this. That's one.I get that, that's one.Mmhmm. Mmhmm.Let's.I should move out of there.That doesn't matter.Maybe just.Move.to Fool's Landing.Try to make your way there. Now we do have two of these flier guys and we only need one, so we could get you there that way too.Sure.Yeah um.Um.So if you have, well you have two moves left, so..So just stop then,.Well we can.to make sure you're not trapped.Right, how about we. Yeah.You could.Move here and then shore Copper Gate.That's a safe move.Hmm. (--) lose.And that would put, that has a chalice.Right.We'll have to keep you on Misty Marsh though.Right.Yeah.But you're way is still clear.Ok.Perfect. Oh boy. Ok.No.Two.One.Oh.One.And two.For you.Ok.And then three Flood Cards.Good.Yeah.So.We only really need to give him out.Work it.One of us.Yeah.Right now.Coral Palace.Coral Palace are you on?.Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate.We're on it.Dunes of Deception.and Silver Gate.ok.That's your turn.Your turn.Yes it is, let's think for a second.Got plenty of time.Ah.Well.Maybe move there and shore both of those up.Right here.Yeah that's what I was thinking.That way I'm not swimming.No you're not swimming. Ok.Hmm.Yeah.Got that.Mmhm.Cool.Aren't those.Those aren't mine. What am I doing.Right ok.Yeah, those are yours, yeah.And you have more than five cards now.Now.I do.You have to hold on to the three (--) toss these . already have.Ditch the five.Here.Right.Yeah yeah.Right ok, cool.Yeah ah hah.Ok and three.There.Please.No, not from shuffling these.Right.That's only.No, we haven't drawn a thing yet, yeah we need one of these guys.Yeah that's only when we get um.Ah yeah yeah yeah.Ok.Ok, we got.Temple of the Sun.and we got Tidal Palace.Mmhmm.And we got the Bronze Gate.Ok.Ok.Ok.We can work with that.It's gettin' kind of.What?.What? Oh there.Ok, my turn.Yeah.Engineer.Yes.Alright.I see no reason to move you.I don't see alot of reason we would do much of anything.Um.Unless you.Cause next move we could get the Lion.Right.Right.We just have to make sure Howling Garden doesn't sink.Right.And I feel like any second we're gonna get.Oh.A rise Water thing.So.Do you want me to go over and shore them.I guess you can move diagonally.Cause I wont be able to claim any treasure until next time anyway.Right.If you want to maybe move.Oh three turns.Yes.Yeah I could shore both of these.I think it's a--.Good.Ok.Look out.So.Oh right, you can cool.Ah.Like that?.MIght as well keep as much safe as we can.Right.Ok.Ok.Treasure for you.Treasure.Two please don't be a water rise.

Maybe just getting green over to Fool's landing?.Yeah maybe getting her.out of danger.Okay.Oh that's cool.So do you just want to move here?.So let's do that.We'll just get you there, and now I'd love to take that.Alright.Ok.(--) great.We have four.

without it counting as one action right?.I didn't think.or.I think it does count as I think like one turn, so this will be like one.Yeah.That's what I thought too.And then this will be two.Are we just.and.But then you can't.cause you're.can't shore any, or no adjacent tile, never mind, ok.Yup.You good?.Um.Alright and then I'll just shore this up.(Right).That'll be my third.Ok.Yeah.Alright.Ok

One, two shore.Right ok.Two moves and a shore.Ok.Oh no, they always seem to fall on you.Two cards, jeez.Ok so we're in to three now and.So I have to.discard but.yeah discard.This is fine so.Yeah.Yeah.Mmhmm.ta.Oh wait.Let me there.Ok.Around three right?.So Temple of the Moon, Whispering Garden and Lost Lagoon.Lost Lagoon is gone.Mmm, Lost Lagoon.(--).Ok.Um.So I guess I can flip this.back over and then ah.Yup.Yup.So I'm gonna.Give you that.I'm gonna flip this.And.Um.Just move somewhere.ta.Yeah.Misty Marsh, join the party.Maybe you just mvoe closer to everything.Yeah I'll join there.Alright so now I do two treasure cards so I have sandbags.Do you want me to shore up Whispering Garden just in case?.Cause I have two of them so.Yeah.Yeah just in case cause.Cause we don't want to lose that.Um.Ok and then.I do three.Flood cards.Ok Iron Gate which is gonna be gone.

That might be the best just because then I can give you that and you can give that to her.Yeah.Well it's her turn.Oh, and just so I use all three of my actions.Yeah.So.Yeah well I think you should trade her that, but.Trade me.for the shattered globe thing.I see.Oh wait, can't you can't do that.Well you can't.You can't, he can only give you. You have to wait till your turn to give him the other one.Oh.Yeah.Ok but then I'll have to discard one.Then you have to discard something.Um fire or.I guess we'll give up on fire.You might as well discard that or not that.Not that one. Discard a fire because you'll do the lions, he'll do the globes and she'll do the ocean.Well maybe.I don't know.Ok.Ok because we have enough cards for that.Then I'll just skip the fire.Yeah kind of anyway.Oh.Ok.Yeah.I think that's probably.And I'm the Messenger, so I'll just keep.Unless yeah unless you happen to get fire but.And that.Give a single card to another player.Well that, he's gonna move there so.Yeah.Yeha so.Just out of order but yeah.Yeah, yeah.Good.So and then.alright.shore up so that's three?.And then shore up and that is three moves.

Team3201.csv,"Ok.It seemed like the first move..I'm gonna do the same thing. Um I think for this round we should.like.this card and like these two cards.let them fall off right..You're gonna let them fall off ok..yeah.So.Cool.I'm gonna.Shore those up.Shore two move and then shore the next two..Ok.There are your cards..They're matching ok..Could you spread those out so you could see? Yeah.There's more? Oh sure. Raising the water level already..And then we should shuffle those.So you have to shuffle.I don't, I guess maybe these were left over or maybe.And I'll throw that for ya.should these have been shuffled before hand, I don't know..That was gonna be my question but.Um.And then two.Alright.Alright Cliffs of Abandon.Oh I think, I think we've been rotated a little bit.(--).the cards, and ah Breaker's Bridge.Ok.(--).Ok well glad I did that..Think you, think you know you're first move next time?.Um.Yeah.And I'm up.Yup.Alrighty.Um.being that it's your action it probably makes no sense for me to move there and then shore them up unless you think it's gonna come up..Do you have anything else to do? Ok, might as well.You know what.I really.I really have nothing else to do so.Ok nothing else, let him do it..Let's go ahead and do that..So that's your three?.Pick up two of those?.Two of these bad boys..Hmm the Sandbag..Thank you Lost Lagoon and Temple of the Moon. Oh they moved it..Yeah.Used to be up there.Temple.Oh we're on it.Oh ok.Alright.Good job shoring..Ok.And.That's it..Let's see where do I want to move.Um.I don't really have any, I guess I'm going for these, you're going for those.Well do you want me to hang out with you guys and.We'll see where she's going.shore that up?.You could fly here and shore both of them up..Oh that's a good point..Yeah..Or um.I would do that cause you have no.I'm at.Yeah.Might as well.Definite.Yeah nothing else to do ok..So there's your.Ok.Move and.Shore.And shore those up?.Alright.I'll take my cards two of them.Yup.Two actions..(--).No rising water..Ok I got another Helicopter Lift, that's nice to have and the chalice..You're the Helicopter master of there..Ok.Here are your flood cards..Ok Phanthom Rock and Gold Gate..Ok.Gold Gate is gone..Well that doesn't really matter. Ok.Phantom rock is gone perfect..Good job.We don't want those on the board, no they go over there..Put those over there.Oh no never mind they go here..Those go with those..Engineer.Yeah.Alright.So I suppose I should.maybe I give you one of these?.Oh well I'm at four I could hold it so and it's good to give it to me cause I could always get rid of them if need be..Yeah.Um.Right so.on.So there's one.Ok.Yup so that's one and I suppose.There's nothing to shore up or anything you should probably start moving towards the goblet..Yeah.Yeah where's.We got one there and one there..Where's ok, does it?.Is there a particular.I'm just gonna head straight across and then maybe I can just shore some stuff up over there..Sounds good..Although.which cards have been flipped so far, it's been like these few.Yeah it seems like.so maybe I should stay around this area.yeah so if you go here you're equal distance to both..One.That's two turns.I need two and you don't have to do a third if you don't want.Two turns.Ok yeah.up to three.Yeah that makes sense for now..Mmhmm..There's your treasures.Ok alright (--) get there..Nice.There's your flood.Ok Whispering gardens.Whispering.And Iron Gate.(--).Copper Gate.Iron gate right here. Got it..So.Ok..So leave that one we want to save this one then..Hmm.Correct.Um these go there..And it's my turn..I got five right now..And.Do I have to, oh we did that..I yeah.I got five right now.Um.unhelp you.unhelp you.take it.we'll give them that.At some point I should get that.Yeah I was just thinking that.The goblet.Um.Just is it ok if I put this here?.Somebody should go up and save this..Yeah that's fine.Somebody should go up and save this.My I got a Sandbag.Unless we want to just.I'll just use my three actions yeah.I mean.(--).We could.One.Two.Save it.Yeah ok.Yeah.Um.Cause I really have.My second thought was.I'm not going there.If all four of them are sort of sequestered here we can just like.let that.let this whole side of the island fall off..Exactly.Alright and just work on the treasures over here..Yeah.Yeah.Alright so.Yeah.Um I did three.Pick up two.So I got a rising water, so can you raise that one please, let's shuffle these..Um I'm trying to think what you should keep..Put them back here, this goes here..Well I'm just gonna.Just gonna.Might as well I'm.Well.Um.Ah that.You two can meet up and she could start collecting those. She could give that over so.Ok.Ok if you want to use a Sandbag you can use it now or.Up to you.What's a Sandbag again?.I could shore up anything.It would just would just be shoring up the, the useless card..And that gets me down to five. That's the reason..Yeah.We'll prioritize that yeah sure..Ok.better than that (--).right.And I gotta take my.I already took them that's why I got it so we're at three now..Yup.Alrighty. Cliffs of Abandon, Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden is at the top..Yup.Cliffs of Abandon looks like.Oh.what you're standing on..Yeah.Ok.Yeah.Pilot.So I want to.get my chalice to you..Ok.I'm.(--).So.Eventually.on my next turn I suppose.I would be able to move here to here..I.A suggestion she could fly anywhere as her ability, counts as one, so one flip it.Sure.Sure.and give the card there's three turns..Ok.We've covered everything that'd we'd like..Ok.Um.Ok yeah, yeah we'll do that.Cause.Cause it's really.that's essentially flying.(--) so.And then you can give him.the.ah goblet of the earth..ok.and then.I think I just moved..The only thing is that.but the chalice is (--) yeah.that has a thing (--)..um.that's fine.just want to make sure we don't lose.ok.well we could.preferably not.right right.right.Um.So that was your three so take your two there..So pick up two.Yup.And then there's Sandbag's I could.That's helpful.Good job.Save that if need be.Keep that there and then we know how many actions, yeah yeah.Ok sorry.Just a suggestion.Do you want to use this now or we can play at anytime so that's fine..No you're at five you could hold it..Yup.Ok.And we're ok sort of letting go of this portion..Yeah.Ok.Let's see what we've got to get rid of, Iron Gate..Gate.Temple of the Moon here, Iron Gate.Temple of the Moon, ok..And Breaker's Bridge.Breaker's Bridge.Bridge.Good job, good job..Alright we want to save this guy..Right.Yeah.Ok.Alright it's my turn.Hmm.Alright so I should.Um.Make a run for the treasure cause that's how we win..Right, ah it's right here..Oh.Well.Um.One, shore it up.two is it an action to use these?.Yeah that's one action, um.Oh it is to get the treasure?.So maybe if I move one anybody have a Helicopter?.Ah yes I do..Ok.She has two.So I could.I could move one, shore.and then you could trans-.transport me.And then I could.(--).get the treasure.And then that way we would save these two.Oh cause it's not an action.or well I suppose.we only really need to save this guy right?.Right.Yeah, correct.Go one.Ah I still have to move.Um what do you think? Do you want to use a helicopter?.Yeah I have another one so, yeah..Cause you got two, yeah..Ok.So let's shore that up and get the treasure. That'll also clean this out for when you get your action cards..Shore up, you're gonna fly.Ok so put that there..Is it, are we flying just me?.Yes.Or both of us?.Ah.Yeah I think it makes sense to put everybody over there..I think just you just.Oh really? Ok.Right.Cause if this half the island's falling off.And we don't care about that, then ok.So we'll both fly over here..And then.Ok.And there's your goblet.Purchase the little goblet and then see you later..Here's your.Shoot.And like I said we could use the Sandbag's for some reason..Right.The other one starts to go or whatever we can retrieve it..Right.There's that and here's your.three.Cop-.the nice thing is is that everything is sort of centralized in two different areas versus.Yeah.Copper.Gate.Copper gate.Crimson Forest.And Temple of the Sun.Crimson Forest.Copper Gate.Temple of the Sun.Ok.So we want to.Good job saving the Temple of the Moon.Yeah.Yeah.Alright so you're done with your turn?.Yes um.Alright.Yup.So let's see.So you probably want to stay.around here.yeah.agreed.Um.(--).I'm thinking.Did you want to start collecting something?.I was thinking I would collect fire and you can start collecting.Yeah do you want to start getting my lions?.the ah.Ok.So I could actually pass both of these over as two turns to you..And then start moving in closer.So here's.Ok.ok.Um.two actions.And you have to get rid of one..Then you'll have to get rid of one but you'll have to use the Sandbag.Right.So if we don't care part maybe use the Sandbag on the Island, the Temple of the Sun.Ok.So you don't have to just waste it..Sure, I'll do that right now..Ok.And.Alright.That's my three actions. My treasure, raise the water please..That's a wasted card so that one I'll get rid of when I can next time and.Ok.Put it over there.Almost.Whoo.We got ah Temple of the Moon Iron.Gate.and Whispering Gardens.(Good fun).I knew that was gonna go ok just make sure you don't lose the other one..Yeah.Yeah.That's what our Sandbags are for.Ah I know.Pilot, you're up.Ok.Let's see so.is there anything worth shoring up?.Mmm.Not.really because these things don't matter at all.Right.That would be the only one but we still have that one..You don't want to get too far away from him because he's going to be giving you the lion shortly..Right.Right so should I just go to the lion now?.You might just wannna.Suggest.Do you want to do you want to give me the purple and maybe I'll start collecting.Purples?.Sure.purples?.Perfect.That's fine, ok that's one move..That's one..And then should I go to the Lion already?.Um.Well yeah I need to transfer first.yes.right.Ok.yeah.so.so that'll be on the next turn around..There's really no advantage to and we don't care about those..Ok.Um.I mean should I.I mean if I have extra turns should I.but there's nothing I shore up anyways without moving, so no it's it's silly. Ok..Well it'll cost him two actions to get it to you then..Yay two of these?.Two of those..Ok another yay Helicopter Lift. That's good..Alright.Ok.And you'll have to get rid of one..Ok.Ah.Can I.(--).Can you.can she give that to me without she has to drop that one first..No cause it's it.Cause it's a different it's not a.The right you're passsed the action. Correct..And the action's already gone. Ok..Um.So.why don't you fly me.Ok.Well.So sorry you want to the fire right?.anywhere you want?.Right.So.which is I'm one away..if you bring us here, I can give you a fire and then we can all sort of do trade..Oh yeah fly me there and we can just have like a big trading session..Ok that sounds good..Ok, perfect..Helicopter Lift.So we're down to five. Here's your three floods..All together thank you..Hopefully we get rid of that end of the island..Ok..Lost Lagoon..Lost Lagoon's gone..Breaker's Bridge..Breaker's Bridge is gone..Also gone..And Cliffs of Abandon..Excellent..Unimportant..Ok..And Engineer..It's your turn..Alright..So um I need to transfer.this to you and that to you and that'll be two..Correct..And then I should probably.stay where I'm at..For trading purposes..Right..Except now I'll have six in my hand..Oh you should have given him the purple on here..But, but, but we didn't know that before hand and you used.Hmm.Right.you used all three of your.Oh you pulled that so there's no way you could have ok.Right.yeah.um.so may well I can give you fire for sure..Yup.That doesn't affect anything..Um.Should we decide.definitely get the treasure, that's how we win yeah..what to get rid of there?.Yeah.So let's get rid of the.Ok.But then we also have enough purples as a group.Right.to, to continue..But I can't transfer anything right now. Should we wait?.You know what but we'll just keep drawing cards until we get a Helicopter card.or.so I'd say get rid of the Helicopter card..Ok I'm.cause we have enough to get the three..And it's not worth flying anybody right now cause we still have to trade.Right.Exactly.So get rid of the Helicopter Lift?.Well he hasn't given it to you yet, but that's the thought. It would be my thought..Ok (--) agreement, I guess..Sounds good..Unless there's another plan on the table..Ok that's.Ok.that's fine.So you got the four there.So I just.discard it ok..Yup..Yup..Yeah and then on your next move you move and do that..Right..Now I should grab two of those..Take your actions..Alright.Um so now I know what I'm getting rid of and I should probably trade, well I can't.right.right cause of the actions parts.Yeah.So here's your three floods..ok.Temple of the Sun is done..Temple of the Sun, Copper Gate.Copper Gate..That's out..Copper Gate.Card.And Crimson Forest.Is that Copper Gate? Crimson Forest is the burning forest one..is also out..Oh.Oh that doesn't matter..There you go..Looking for a red forest up there..Alright.One thing that I just realized is that.As we let that.let the island go, the other islands will be exposed to being pulled up..That's a good point..That's true..That is true..Didn't think of that..Yeah I didn't think of that.Alright so.Oh um ok.Somebody should definitely.Move over there and save.Oh here's a great idea, here's two actions I'll give you that, get rid of the purple cause now we enough to have all three treasures in the next round..Well.Well don't we need to save.one of the purples?.Ah not if we're discarding the purples cause I'm gonna give you these, we'll have three treasures. Purple is the wasted treasure..Oh ok, that's fine..Yeah..That works. That makes sense..So here's two actions..Ok.And I need to get rid of the purple..Yup.And now I have an action, we're.So that was two actions.You should stay.Yeah.what.Towards Fool's Landing and get.what you need.to get to fire because you're gonna.I.I'm not collecting anything.Oh, oh ok..You guys need to get there right?.Ok right, right..yeah cause we already have four, you have four..I'm just getting to Fool's Landing to try to end the game, and hopefully I get a Helicopter Lift here, which I did, so.Then we be out.(--) you still have five. Good enough..And then five, good, three floods..Ok..I got..Dunes of Deception, Silver Gate up there..Do we.And Tidal Palace.Right here.Ok and Pilot you're up..Ok.So you should definitely get the treasure.Yeah that's first order of business, yes I'm near the blue one..So one action.You're red, not blue.What?.Ok.Yay, Yay.Yay same treasures as last time I realized..Just steal that..There you go..Ok those are gone..Ok.And now start making a run to Fool's Landing cause we'll have our treasure..Right cause he already has that. Perfect..And actually you can use your flying power and just be there..Yeah, Yay!.There's your two actions..That's ah right.Just don't really need anything and hopefully.Floods.Ok.Cave of Embers.(--) that window..And.Bronze Gate.Right here..I don't think we've done that one yet..Ok.Doesn't affect anything. Alright..Ok almost there..Good show gang..Um so now it's my turn..So.So you're gonna get the treasure at the Cave of Shadows and head towards the Fool's Landing cause we'll have our three treasures and now we're just waiting for a.Helicopter Lift to win..Lift.Ok.So move.move, take.trade, then move..Move.Ah do want me to save anything while I'm in it or not, not worth it?.Ah that'll be your three moves, one taking it so that's your three actions. Yup..Ok cool. Go ahead and do that for me..Ok.Here's your fire..Here's a trade in..These.Sweet.We win once we get there as long as we don't die first..yeah and if you fall in the water.Ah you gotta shuffle these first before you pull, yeah..Oh thank you..If you fall in the water then you can swim..I'm a great swimmer..Still.Actually I'll swim to Fool's Landing so..Oh I shouldn't..Mmmhmm..There you go..Knock me in the water..Ok.And oh sorry..Oh on top..Yup.Ah these are no longer discarded..There you go..Yup and here are your three..And.Do I pick up two of those or?.I gave you two, yup..Ok.Yup.Thank you..Cave of Embers.Embers is gone..Tidal Palace and Silver Gate..Tidal Palace, Silver Gate..(--).Ok we'll take all the cards..Oh all of them?.Or.Cause they all yeah..They all went?.Yup.Ok.You know with 18 minutes, how's life going?.It's going ok..Alright um.So.I'll save these two and then move here, ah.for my three actions.cause.ok.like we pointed out.sure.yeah.It said it keeps cards.Ok so pull.in the game..And it doesn't matter.Pull two.Doesn't matter.

Um I think for this round we should.like.this card and like these two cards.let them fall off right.You're gonna let them fall off ok.yeah.So.Cool.I'm gonna.Shore those up.Shore two move and then shore the next two.Ok.There are your cards.They're matching ok.Could you spread those out so you could see? Yeah.There's more? Oh sure. Raising the water level already.And then we should shuffle those.So you have to shuffle.I don't, I guess maybe these were left over or maybe.And I'll throw that for ya.should these have been shuffled before hand, I don't know.That was gonna be my question but.Um.And then two.Alright.Alright Cliffs of Abandon.Oh I think, I think we've been rotated a little bit.(--).the cards, and ah Breaker's Bridge.Ok.(--).Ok well glad I did that.Think you, think you know you're first move next time?.Um.Yeah.And I'm up.Yup.Alrighty.Um.being that it's your action it probably makes no sense for me to move there and then shore them up unless you think it's gonna come up.Do you have anything else to do? Ok, might as well.You know what.I really.I really have nothing else to do so.Ok nothing else, let him do it.Let's go ahead and do that.So that's your three?.Pick up two of those?.Two of these bad boys.Hmm the Sandbag.Thank you Lost Lagoon and Temple of the Moon. Oh they moved it.Yeah.Used to be up there.Temple.Oh we're on it.Oh ok.Alright.Good job shoring.Ok.And.That's it.Let's see where do I want to move.Um.I don't really have any, I guess I'm going for these, you're going for those.Well do you want me to hang out with you guys and.We'll see where she's going.shore that up?.You could fly here and shore both of them up.Oh that's a good point.Yeah.Or um.I would do that cause you have no.I'm at.Yeah.Might as well.Definite.Yeah nothing else to do ok.So there's your.Ok.Move and.Shore.And shore those up?.Alright.I'll take my cards two of them.Yup.Two actions.(--).No rising water.Ok I got another Helicopter Lift, that's nice to have and the chalice.You're the Helicopter master of there.Ok.Here are your flood cards.Ok Phanthom Rock and Gold Gate.Ok.Gold Gate is gone.Well that doesn't really matter. Ok.Phantom rock is gone perfect.Good job.We don't want those on the board, no they go over there.Put those over there.Oh no never mind they go here.Those go with those.Engineer.Yeah.Alright.So I suppose I should.maybe I give you one of these?.Oh well I'm at four I could hold it so and it's good to give it to me cause I could always get rid of them if need be.Yeah.Um.Right so.on.So there's one.Ok.Yup so that's one and I suppose.There's nothing to shore up or anything you should probably start moving towards the goblet.Yeah.Yeah where's.We got one there and one there.Where's ok, does it?.Is there a particular.I'm just gonna head straight across and then maybe I can just shore some stuff up over there.Sounds good.Although.which cards have been flipped so far, it's been like these few.Yeah it seems like.so maybe I should stay around this area.yeah so if you go here you're equal distance to both.One.That's two turns.I need two and you don't have to do a third if you don't want.Two turns.Ok yeah.up to three.Yeah that makes sense for now.Mmhmm.There's your treasures.Ok alright (--) get there.Nice.There's your flood.Ok Whispering gardens.Whispering.And Iron Gate.(--).Copper Gate.Iron gate right here. Got it.So.Ok.So leave that one we want to save this one then.Hmm.Correct.Um these go there.And it's my turn.I got five right now.And.Do I have to, oh we did that.I yeah.I got five right now.Um.unhelp you.unhelp you.take it.we'll give them that.At some point I should get that.Yeah I was just thinking that.The goblet.Um.Just is it ok if I put this here?.Somebody should go up and save this.Yeah that's fine.Somebody should go up and save this.My I got a Sandbag.Unless we want to just.I'll just use my three actions yeah.I mean.(--).We could.One.Two.Save it.Yeah ok.Yeah.Um.Cause I really have.My second thought was.I'm not going there.If all four of them are sort of sequestered here we can just like.let that.let this whole side of the island fall off.Exactly.Alright and just work on the treasures over here.Yeah.Yeah.Alright so.Yeah.Um I did three.Pick up two.So I got a rising water, so can you raise that one please, let's shuffle these.Um I'm trying to think what you should keep.Put them back here, this goes here.Well I'm just gonna.Just gonna.Might as well I'm.Well.Um.Ah that.You two can meet up and she could start collecting those. She could give that over so.Ok.Ok if you want to use a Sandbag you can use it now or.Up to you.What's a Sandbag again?.I could shore up anything.It would just would just be shoring up the, the useless card.And that gets me down to five. That's the reason.Yeah.We'll prioritize that yeah sure.Ok.better than that (--).right.And I gotta take my.I already took them that's why I got it so we're at three now.Yup.Alrighty. Cliffs of Abandon, Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden is at the top.Yup.Cliffs of Abandon looks like.Oh.what you're standing on.Yeah.Ok.Yeah.Pilot.So I want to.get my chalice to you.Ok.I'm.(--).So.Eventually.on my next turn I suppose.I would be able to move here to here.I.A suggestion she could fly anywhere as her ability, counts as one, so one flip it.Sure.Sure.and give the card there's three turns.Ok.We've covered everything that'd we'd like.Ok.Um.Ok yeah, yeah we'll do that.Cause.Cause it's really.that's essentially flying.(--) so.And then you can give him.the.ah goblet of the earth.ok.and then.I think I just moved.The only thing is that.but the chalice is (--) yeah.that has a thing (--).um.that's fine.just want to make sure we don't lose.ok.well we could.preferably not.right right.right.Um.So that was your three so take your two there.So pick up two.Yup.And then there's Sandbag's I could.That's helpful.Good job.Save that if need be.Keep that there and then we know how many actions, yeah yeah.Ok sorry.Just a suggestion.Do you want to use this now or we can play at anytime so that's fine.No you're at five you could hold it.Yup.Ok.And we're ok sort of letting go of this portion.Yeah.Ok.Let's see what we've got to get rid of, Iron Gate.Gate.Temple of the Moon here, Iron Gate.Temple of the Moon, ok.And Breaker's Bridge.Breaker's Bridge.Bridge.Good job, good job.Alright we want to save this guy.Right.Yeah.Ok.Alright it's my turn.Hmm.Alright so I should.Um.Make a run for the treasure cause that's how we win.Right, ah it's right here.Oh.Well.Um.One, shore it up.two is it an action to use these?.Yeah that's one action, um.Oh it is to get the treasure?.So maybe if I move one anybody have a Helicopter?.Ah yes I do.Ok.She has two.So I could.I could move one, shore.and then you could trans-.transport me.And then I could.(--).get the treasure.And then that way we would save these two.Oh cause it's not an action.or well I suppose.we only really need to save this guy right?.Right.Yeah, correct.Go one.Ah I still have to move.Um what do you think? Do you want to use a helicopter?.Yeah I have another one so, yeah.Cause you got two, yeah.Ok.So let's shore that up and get the treasure. That'll also clean this out for when you get your action cards.Shore up, you're gonna fly.Ok so put that there.Is it, are we flying just me?.Yes.Or both of us?.Ah.Yeah I think it makes sense to put everybody over there.I think just you just.Oh really? Ok.Right.Cause if this half the island's falling off.And we don't care about that, then ok.So we'll both fly over here.And then.Ok.And there's your goblet.Purchase the little goblet and then see you later.Here's your.Shoot.And like I said we could use the Sandbag's for some reason.Right.The other one starts to go or whatever we can retrieve it.Right.There's that and here's your.three.Cop-.the nice thing is is that everything is sort of centralized in two different areas versus.Yeah.Copper.Gate.Copper gate.Crimson Forest.And Temple of the Sun.Crimson Forest.Copper Gate.Temple of the Sun.Ok.So we want to.Good job saving the Temple of the Moon.Yeah.Yeah.Alright so you're done with your turn?.Yes um.Alright.Yup.So let's see.So you probably want to stay.around here.yeah.agreed.Um.(--).I'm thinking.Did you want to start collecting something?.I was thinking I would collect fire and you can start collecting.Yeah do you want to start getting my lions?.the ah.Ok.So I could actually pass both of these over as two turns to you.And then start moving in closer.So here's.Ok.ok.Um.two actions.And you have to get rid of one.Then you'll have to get rid of one but you'll have to use the Sandbag.Right.So if we don't care part maybe use the Sandbag on the Island, the Temple of the Sun.Ok.So you don't have to just waste it.Sure, I'll do that right now.Ok.And.Alright.That's my three actions. My treasure, raise the water please.That's a wasted card so that one I'll get rid of when I can next time and.Ok.Put it over there.Almost.Whoo.We got ah Temple of the Moon Iron.Gate.and Whispering Gardens.(Good fun).I knew that was gonna go ok just make sure you don't lose the other one.Yeah.Yeah.That's what our Sandbags are for.Ah I know.Pilot, you're up.Ok.Let's see so.is there anything worth shoring up?.Mmm.Not.really because these things don't matter at all.Right.That would be the only one but we still have that one.You don't want to get too far away from him because he's going to be giving you the lion shortly.Right.Right so should I just go to the lion now?.You might just wannna.Suggest.Do you want to do you want to give me the purple and maybe I'll start collecting.Purples?.Sure.purples?.Perfect.That's fine, ok that's one move.That's one.And then should I go to the Lion already?.Um.Well yeah I need to transfer first.yes.right.Ok.yeah.so.so that'll be on the next turn around.There's really no advantage to and we don't care about those.Ok.Um.I mean should I.I mean if I have extra turns should I.but there's nothing I shore up anyways without moving, so no it's it's silly. Ok.Well it'll cost him two actions to get it to you then.Yay two of these?.Two of those.Ok another yay Helicopter Lift. That's good.Alright.Ok.And you'll have to get rid of one.Ok.Ah.Can I.(--).Can you.can she give that to me without she has to drop that one first.No cause it's it.Cause it's a different it's not a.The right you're passsed the action. Correct.And the action's already gone. Ok.Um.So.why don't you fly me.Ok.Well.So sorry you want to the fire right?.anywhere you want?.Right.So.which is I'm one away.if you bring us here, I can give you a fire and then we can all sort of do trade.Oh yeah fly me there and we can just have like a big trading session.Ok that sounds good.Ok, perfect.Helicopter Lift.So we're down to five. Here's your three floods.All together thank you.Hopefully we get rid of that end of the island.Ok.Lost Lagoon.Lost Lagoon's gone.Breaker's Bridge.Breaker's Bridge is gone.Also gone.And Cliffs of Abandon.Excellent.Unimportant.Ok.And Engineer.It's your turn.Alright.So um I need to transfer.this to you and that to you and that'll be two.Correct.And then I should probably.stay where I'm at.For trading purposes.Right.Except now I'll have six in my hand.Oh you should have given him the purple on here.But, but, but we didn't know that before hand and you used.Hmm.Right.you used all three of your.Oh you pulled that so there's no way you could have ok.Right.yeah.um.so may well I can give you fire for sure.Yup.That doesn't affect anything.Um.Should we decide.definitely get the treasure, that's how we win yeah.what to get rid of there?.Yeah.So let's get rid of the.Ok.But then we also have enough purples as a group.Right.to, to continue.But I can't transfer anything right now. Should we wait?.You know what but we'll just keep drawing cards until we get a Helicopter card.or.so I'd say get rid of the Helicopter card.Ok I'm.cause we have enough to get the three.And it's not worth flying anybody right now cause we still have to trade.Right.Exactly.So get rid of the Helicopter Lift?.Well he hasn't given it to you yet, but that's the thought. It would be my thought.Ok (--) agreement, I guess.Sounds good.Unless there's another plan on the table.Ok that's.Ok.that's fine.So you got the four there.So I just.discard it ok.Yup.Yup.Yeah and then on your next move you move and do that.Right.Now I should grab two of those.Take your actions.Alright.Um so now I know what I'm getting rid of and I should probably trade, well I can't.right.right cause of the actions parts.Yeah.So here's your three floods.ok.Temple of the Sun is done.Temple of the Sun, Copper Gate.Copper Gate.That's out.Copper Gate.Card.And Crimson Forest.Is that Copper Gate? Crimson Forest is the burning forest one.is also out.Oh.Oh that doesn't matter.There you go.Looking for a red forest up there.Alright.One thing that I just realized is that.As we let that.let the island go, the other islands will be exposed to being pulled up.That's a good point.That's true.That is true.Didn't think of that.Yeah I didn't think of that.Alright so.Oh um ok.Somebody should definitely.Move over there and save.Oh here's a great idea, here's two actions I'll give you that, get rid of the purple cause now we enough to have all three treasures in the next round.Well.Well don't we need to save.one of the purples?.Ah not if we're discarding the purples cause I'm gonna give you these, we'll have three treasures. Purple is the wasted treasure.Oh ok, that's fine.Yeah.That works. That makes sense.So here's two actions.Ok.And I need to get rid of the purple.Yup.And now I have an action, we're.So that was two actions.You should stay.Yeah.what.Towards Fool's Landing and get.what you need.to get to fire because you're gonna.I.I'm not collecting anything.Oh, oh ok.You guys need to get there right?.Ok right, right.yeah cause we already have four, you have four.I'm just getting to Fool's Landing to try to end the game, and hopefully I get a Helicopter Lift here, which I did, so.Then we be out.(--) you still have five. Good enough.And then five, good, three floods.Ok.I got.Dunes of Deception, Silver Gate up there.Do we.And Tidal Palace.Right here.Ok and Pilot you're up.Ok.So you should definitely get the treasure.Yeah that's first order of business, yes I'm near the blue one.So one action.You're red, not blue.What?.Ok.Yay, Yay.Yay same treasures as last time I realized.Just steal that.There you go.Ok those are gone.Ok.And now start making a run to Fool's Landing cause we'll have our treasure.Right cause he already has that. Perfect.And actually you can use your flying power and just be there.Yeah, Yay!.There's your two actions.That's ah right.Just don't really need anything and hopefully.Floods.Ok.Cave of Embers.(--) that window.And.Bronze Gate.Right here.I don't think we've done that one yet.Ok.Doesn't affect anything. Alright.Ok almost there.Good show gang.Um so now it's my turn.So.So you're gonna get the treasure at the Cave of Shadows and head towards the Fool's Landing cause we'll have our three treasures and now we're just waiting for a.Helicopter Lift to win.Lift.Ok.So move.move, take.trade, then move.Move.Ah do want me to save anything while I'm in it or not, not worth it?.Ah that'll be your three moves, one taking it so that's your three actions. Yup.Ok cool. Go ahead and do that for me.Ok.Here's your fire.Here's a trade in.These.Sweet.We win once we get there as long as we don't die first.yeah and if you fall in the water.Ah you gotta shuffle these first before you pull, yeah.Oh thank you.If you fall in the water then you can swim.I'm a great swimmer.Still.Actually I'll swim to Fool's Landing so.Oh I shouldn't.Mmmhmm.There you go.Knock me in the water.Ok.And oh sorry.Oh on top.Yup.Ah these are no longer discarded.There you go.Yup and here are your three.And.Do I pick up two of those or?.I gave you two, yup.Ok.Yup.Thank you.Cave of Embers.Embers is gone.Tidal Palace and Silver Gate.Tidal Palace, Silver Gate.(--).Ok we'll take all the cards.Oh all of them?.Or.Cause they all yeah.They all went?.Yup.Ok.You know with 18 minutes, how's life going?.It's going ok.Alright um.So.I'll save these two and then move here, ah.for my three actions.cause.ok.like we pointed out.sure.yeah.It said it keeps cards.Ok so pull.in the game.And it doesn't matter.Pull two.Doesn't matter. Alright pull two and pull three here.Um.And now three.But we're allowed to use this at any time.Oh yeah why don't we just win the game. Yeah,that's a good point.in the process, do you want to just win now?.Yeah let's just win.Ok so that's it.Yeah.Yeah!.Time, we beat it.Better time than the last time.Time yeah.Yeah good, good thinking. We should have used it yeah before my turn.I was like huh?.Yeah.We could, stretch, stretch it out.Yeah.Cool b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sv  b  %  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  %

Team3252.csv,"Okeydoke, let's see. Well I should probably start shoring this up..Yeah.Mmhmm.Ah.And because I get two for one because (--).Yeah.And then should I move here and shore these two up and.finish my turn? or is there something else I should do?.Could you use that double shore.multuple times?.I'm pretty sure cause it's my power..You shore up two tiles per action..I ju-.Right?.Oh yes they just count as another action..Yeah so I can do that again right?.I think so yeah.And then my turn will be sending over two treasure cards..Mmhmm..Oh.Oh Water Rise, ok..So move this up. So move this up.So move this over here right? Yeah.Yup.Mmhmm..Put that on top and then still pick two..Phantom Rock and Break.er's.Bridge..Phantom Rock's gone..It didn't have anything on it though..Ok so it doesn't really matter..Phantom Rock goes over here though..Oh right..Mmhmm..And now it's your turn..Good.So you have two of each so far..Two of.Yeah.Yeah.Two of the green, two of the red.Um.Well this is.The only one.there aren't any flooded ones that really matter as far as the treasures..ta.(you guys) are gonna move.farther in.or if you.Let's see the red ones are here.I could give you this one since you have one of them.ok so that's one.one action..Ok.Mmhmm..And then.So you still have two.Yeah.Mmhmm..Yeah I would just move toward the center..Yeah.I guess we're we're just more (inward).Yeah.One.And that's two, you ready to move on?.Yeah I'll just.Yeah.Ok.(--).So these guys and then.Gold Gate and Whispering Garden so Gold Gate is gone.It's right there.Oh so we have ok.Well got it ok..Cool so you're turn..And then you gotta draw Flood cards.Is there not there wasn't sorry..Those sure did that..I just (said that).Um ok, so.Yeah.Where should I go, I guess it doesn't really matter right now..Um I could just.Well yeah it would be nice if that didn't flood.Yeah fly.There and shore that up.Yeah.Mmhmm..So that's two actions..So thanks.And is there anything else I could do?.(--).Um.No I think it's good to be all generally close together in age..Ok.Yeah.Ok so two treasure cards.(--) Cliffs of Abandon and Lost Lagoon.and Lost Lagoon's right there.Oh.(--).Ok.So we have three reds so far.So.Should I, I could shore these up for.It's a bit mobile.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.So that's one action so I have two more.Sniffs.Um.I don't really have anything.I wouldn't.I think you have just have to start moving this way because.if you end up having them there's a red here and a green here..Oh yeah true..Good point so should I just move here?.Mmhmm.Or so another turn or another option. A second option..Yeah.Should I rest?.Um you might as well just move..Or well I might as well. Should I shore this up while I'm here?.No I it's on the edge there..Or it doesn't really matter..It's on the end so it doesn't matter..Yeah just to be closer to.Ok so that's good, so two of these..Ok.Mmhmm.And now two of these. Ok..And you gotta discard some so.Yeah I gotta discard this one.Yeah that's fine.Ok so Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate.Iron Gate's here.Temple of the Moon ok.Hmm.So you have a (--).So I think it would make sense to move closer to one of these guys so.Do that.Um there aren't really any to shore up..So should I just take three moves and then.and shore that up as your third?.Well it would be.Oh well I could shore it up in here.That would be.Yeah.Yeah.You got.Mmhmm.Um.So Water Rise for you.We're on three now..Yeah.Well good that you did that. Temple of the Moon, what else..Temple of the Moon, Whispering Garden and Lost Lagoon..Lost Lagoon gone..Ok so.We go.ta.Alright so we have four of these now, we just gotta work on.turning them in.Yeah so you'd probably move there and give that me right?.Give it to you.Yeah.Or shore that up.Move here and give it to you and that's my three turns.Yeah.Yeah.Ah yeah sounds good..Ok.So shore that up.Right here.And then you gotta just.And I gotta get rid of this as well.Yeah I guess we'll just work on it as they come..That would be fine..So and then you need two treasures.Here are three of these here..Iron Gate..Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge..Where's Breaker's Bridge..Iron Gate's gone..Ok.Ta.Um and I also five cards total so I'm going to have to (--) I could.use one of these.to in case we ever need it..Like Temple of the Moon or Helicopter Lift..Ok.Ok.Just lettin' you know..So now it's my turn. I'm going to.Yeah.I'm gonna move here first, so one.Yup.Trade that in, want to discard that for me.And then I have um one more action.Is it worth?.Hmm.Do we need anything?.No I don't think so..Not really ok..Well should we.Oh I have to move there though so.Oh ok.Do you think we.We could.No I think we'll be fine because we have two of these anyway..Ok.Yeah.Ok, so give me two treasure.Three of these ok so I got that back so we have.Copper Gate. Crimson Forest and Howling Garden..You just need.and Copper Gate..So nothing flooded ok..Ta.No and we have four of these now spread out among us all..Ok.Ok.Ok.Hmm.So now it's your turn..Yeah so.I'm gonna unsure up this..Yeah.Should I shore up this so we maintain connectivity?.Hmm.or now I should probably shore up this..Yeah cause then we.Well I could do all of them really.Well yeah cause we can only move on a grid..Yeah and I also only have two out of three or four of these so I can't.So we prob.What do you think.Yeah do you think we should just shore up these other two then?.Necessarily..ta.Um.We could and we have sandbags two. We could shore up a bunch of stuff..Oh why don't yeah use the Sandbag's then..Oh yeah.Yeah.Or maybe you.and then what would she do with her turn then?.Trade cards?.Um.Should I just shore up this one and then move here?.Well she could.Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on..If you can you can trade your cards to.She can give them to anyone without being, it just tells us her actions right?.Ah.So each card at.Single card per action. Yes she doesn't have to be with them..And now she has two what?.Yeah so should you just give those to someone?.That's what I was thinking. Probably..Is anyone else closer to.I'm a.Probably me so we can maintain the greens..Yeah.Cause you'll have to.Oh no no no.Yeah not I wouldn't have to and no I'm right there..Yeah you'd have to discard one once I give.And like.Yeah.my fourth one to you.Yeah.But we already also have two yellow so you can just put that there instead..Yeah.should we do that?.That makes sense so.I've done one turn, this will be my second..Or the.Oh yeah the actions.And third that yeah that counts as both right?.Yeah.(--) action..So then you're turn is over so now you need two treasures.Well can I do like a third action just.No cause you already did that one. Cause remember we messed it up each.shore up this?.No the.time you give me a card it counts as a.action.Yeah so you gave her two cards and.But isn't it different since I'm the messenger I can do more than one?.No it just you're not geographically bound..Oh.Yeah.Cause we weren't on the same tile..One actions, I understand ok..I understand..Water Rise.Cliffs of Abandon, Howling Garden and Crimson Forest..This one's Cliffs of Abandon is out..So that's gone..So is Howling Garden. So we gotta protect Whispering Garden if we want that..Mmhmm..Ok.Crimson Forest.Yeah.Well we got Sandbag's so we can.Did you, did we not.move that one? Oh.Or is that one out too or did you already flip that?.I don't.Um.I didn't flip it..You did not?.Ok so that's out too then..No..So all of them are gone ok..By ok.You're turn..Ta.My turn right?.Yeah and you're.Are you.blue?.Yup.Should you move there and give that to me?.That's what I'm thinking..So I can move there for my next turn..Cause it won't get flooded anyways..And one.Yup.turn.So I'll move here as one action.One.two.Two then I have to get rid of this..And then.Should you do anything for your third or?.Um.Cause you can fly.right?.Yeah.If you wanted to for your third, if there was somewhere strategic..I guess I could um.Should we.Should you go here to protect that?.Protect, we should protect one of these because.Yeah.Otherwise I can't get around..Yeah.back to the Fool's.Yeah but we have Helicopter Lifts too, I could fly you.yeah.Ok that's true..Should you.Since we already lost this I should just go here you think?.Yeah might as well right?.For your third one?.And then if that's around I can unshore it next turn or something..yeah.Ok.So now two of those (--).I gotta discard one card..Yeah.Ta I got Breaker's Bridge..That's gone..Whispering Garden..And Temple of the Moon..So this is gone, this gets flipped over and Temple of the Moon gets flipped over too..(--).Ok.(--) sorry..Ok well so I'm gonna do.do one..Trade these in.and now for the third, should I do anything?.The four just in case..Yeah you should probably..When you start.on your.Sandbag this..use these and yeah just to spare it..And I have one more action should I do anything?.I don't really have to..Um, do you want to move closer to Fool's Landing so you're.Oh that's true, might as well take a step forward..Yeah.Oh.So now I need two.(--).Ok well I can maybe even get these (--).Well let's see yeah.Yeah we'll see we have three yellows, three greens, we'll see what, whatever it is..Yeah we'll figure it out. So Copper Gate..Silver Gate and Cave of Embers..Cave of Embers..Silver Gate and.where's Copper Gate?.Gone.Here's that..And these go here..You're turn..Alright.Um.Gonna have to be flying again.Well you might.Should I just.Yeah no I can fly there and then I can fly you..Or well yeah she can fly..Can I.And you could, you could fly her somewhere now right? With an action card..If you needed to..Um.Yeah.Should I just shore up that this time?.(--) I guess it doesn't even matter..Cause you'll be isolated anyways right?.Cause when you go here you can't go diagonally..Yeah.Yeah it depends on if we end up.turning in greens or yellows..Should you shore it up then just to be safe? Yeah..Yeah I guess if you have turns you might as well..Yeah..So that's one..And then two more anything else?.Ten.We don't need that one and then..There are two more actions..I would just.Move right there anyways just because yeah.Oh yeah get closer. Yeah..You could even move on Whispering Garden and then that would be your turn right?.Yeah you could move on..TO be sure yeah that would be three..Mmhmm..Ok..Ok um Bronze Gate, Coral Palace and Dunes of Deception..Where's Coral Palace?.Oh ok..So nothing..Hmm did we do Dunes of Deception?.ta.Yeah we got all three and they're just flooded..Yeah we have four yellows now..Ok.Hmm.So.She just used her turn..So it's your turn..Oh.Oh but we also have four of these too..What if.Oh gotcha, gotcha..Oh ok..So we're kind a.Couldn't be either or.I could well it's your turn next right?.Yeah.And then.Could you use the Helicopter, fly me to the same place as her, I could give her all of those..And then where, where would it be?.Well you could..It's one, oh.Yeah but.Cause I could use my, if I was on the same card as you I could get them all in one turn..But we should probably.protect this because this is going to.Do we have any Sandbags?.Yeah we have one. We could do that..Should we flip that now cause that one's all the way over there right?.We could do that I was thinking cause we have two and two.Or what else.Or what else could we do.Um and we're both already on these and it's my turn.Yeah.I could.Or could you just give those to her?.Give her these two as my two actions.Fly here as my third action and then on my next turn I could use one of these to bring her over here and you'd be there by now.Mmhmm..Oh yeah.Oh perfect ok..Yeah.Yeah that makes sense..You think?.Yeah ok so what do we need to do? It's your turn right?.Yup so.So we're gonna give her those.Yeah and then you.That's two..That's.Two and I have to get rid of.That one..Or get rid of that one, yeah..Just in case so.Well I still.Oh and the Sandbag..And the Sandbags still count. I mean you could use, you could just use the Sandbags if you wanted..Or just get rid of that..Can I.Or no I guess we just save them..Well probably not now cause we already have too many..Yeah get rid of the green one..Yeah ok..So now.And then..you have one more move. Are you gonna do anything? Are you gonna fly yourself?.Yeah so.yeah fly.Yeah.And then two.There you go Misty Marsh.Temple of the Sun.Tidal Palace.Where's Temple of the Sun, oh down here cool, so nothing..Whatever is (--) it's my turn and do I just take my turn going.Mmm ok..To the Landing..Yeah think so..Right.Cause you can fly her to that..Yup..Ok so.Mmhmm..That's two..Oh I got a Water Rise and a Helicopter Lift so..Ok so put that over here, rise that up..This is kind of a whatever shuffle..It's ok..And then we have.Temple of the Moon so that's gone..Um.Whispering Garden..Flip that over and then did you already get Misty Marsh? Is that what you just got?.No that's gone now..Ok.Ok.Now it's your turn..ta.Alright so.(--)so.Hmm.Good.And then.I guess should I just.use this to.Well we could just Helicopter, someone could just Helicopter her there right?.Um.Yeah you could just end your card your turn right now right?.Yeah.Yeah we already have three we just gotta get here and fly you away..Well.But I.But in case.we pick up a flood card and Whispering Garden's (--).Ok yeah it doesn't really matter..Ok yeah it couldn't hurt..On.Undo that.Um I don't really have any other.So now I can use the Helicopter and get her there right? Cause it's a special action?.Yup.So fly that doesn't count as a turn so discard that..and then I could use this right now also cause you can play it at any time right?.Yeah and then we're done right?.Yup",s,sd  b  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  sd  %  b  sd  sd  aa  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  ba  sv  %  b  b  sd  %  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  qy^d  b  b  sd  b  sv  b  sd  sv  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  b  sd  sd  sv  b  sd  b  b  sd  fc  sd  %  %  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  %  b  sd  %  qy  sd  b  b  b  sd  ba  %  sd  sd  sv  sd  aa  sd  b  sv  b  qy  sv  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  ad  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  %  b  b  %  b  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  ad  b  sd  sd  b  b  ba  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  qy  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  qy  b  qy  aa  sd  qy  sd  b  qy  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  b  b  sd  b  h  b  sd  b  sd  %  sd  sv  sd  sd  qo  qy  aa  %  %  sd  qh  b  b  qrr  qw  sd  %  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  qy  aa  qy  %  sd  b  sv  nn  sd  sd  %  b  fc  b  sd  b  qy  aa  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  b  b  sd  b  sd  qy  ad  qy  sd  %  sd  sv  sd  nn  sd  %  sd  %  sd  %  qy  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  %  sv  b  b  sd  sd  qy  qy  sv  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  aa  qy  sd  aa  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  b  fa  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sv  b  b  sd  %  sd  ^h  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sv  qy  sd  sd  %  sd  qw  %  b  qy  sv  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sv  sv  sd  b  b  sd  qw  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  sv  b  sd  %  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  qw  sv  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  qy  sd  %  qh  sd  b  sd  qy  sd  sd  b  b  bk  b  aa  %  qy  aa  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  %  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  %  sd  sv  sd  b  %  %  qy  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  aa  b  sd  b  %  b  sd  sd  ad  sd  bd  sd  sd  %  sd  qy  sd  b  b  ad  %  b  %  b  ba  %  sd  %  sd  %  sv  b  sd  %  %  %  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b,"Okeydoke, let's see. Well I should probably start shoring this up.Yeah.Mmhmm.Ah.And because I get two for one because (--).Yeah.And then should I move here and shore these two up and.finish my turn? or is there something else I should do?.Could you use that double shore.multuple times?.I'm pretty sure cause it's my power.You shore up two tiles per action.I ju-.Right?.Oh yes they just count as another action.Yeah so I can do that again right?.I think so yeah.And then my turn will be sending over two treasure cards.Mmhmm.Oh.Oh Water Rise, ok.So move this up. So move this up.So move this over here right? Yeah.Yup.Mmhmm.Put that on top and then still pick two.Phantom Rock and Break.er's.Bridge.Phantom Rock's gone.It didn't have anything on it though.Ok so it doesn't really matter.Phantom Rock goes over here though.Oh right.Mmhmm.And now it's your turn.Good.So you have two of each so far.Two of.Yeah.Yeah.Two of the green, two of the red.Um.Well this is.The only one.there aren't any flooded ones that really matter as far as the treasures.ta.(you guys) are gonna move.farther in.or if you.Let's see the red ones are here.I could give you this one since you have one of them.ok so that's one.one action.Ok.Mmhmm.And then.So you still have two.Yeah.Mmhmm.Yeah I would just move toward the center.Yeah.I guess we're we're just more (inward).Yeah.One.And that's two, you ready to move on?.Yeah I'll just.Yeah.Ok.(--).So these guys and then.Gold Gate and Whispering Garden so Gold Gate is gone.It's right there.Oh so we have ok.Well got it ok.Cool so you're turn.And then you gotta draw Flood cards.Is there not there wasn't sorry.Those sure did that.I just (said that).Um ok, so.Yeah.Where should I go, I guess it doesn't really matter right now.Um I could just.Well yeah it would be nice if that didn't flood.Yeah fly.There and shore that up.Yeah.Mmhmm.So that's two actions.So thanks.And is there anything else I could do?.(--).Um.No I think it's good to be all generally close together in age.Ok.Yeah.Ok so two treasure cards.(--) Cliffs of Abandon and Lost Lagoon.and Lost Lagoon's right there.Oh.(--).Ok.So we have three reds so far.So.Should I, I could shore these up for.It's a bit mobile.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.So that's one action so I have two more.Sniffs.Um.I don't really have anything.I wouldn't.I think you have just have to start moving this way because.if you end up having them there's a red here and a green here.Oh yeah true.Good point so should I just move here?.Mmhmm.Or so another turn or another option. A second option.Yeah.Should I rest?.Um you might as well just move.Or well I might as well. Should I shore this up while I'm here?.No I it's on the edge there.Or it doesn't really matter.It's on the end so it doesn't matter.Yeah just to be closer to.Ok so that's good, so two of these.Ok.Mmhmm.And now two of these. Ok.And you gotta discard some so.Yeah I gotta discard this one.Yeah that's fine.Ok so Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate.Iron Gate's here.Temple of the Moon ok.Hmm.So you have a (--).So I think it would make sense to move closer to one of these guys so.Do that.Um there aren't really any to shore up.So should I just take three moves and then.and shore that up as your third?.Well it would be.Oh well I could shore it up in here.That would be.Yeah.Yeah.You got.Mmhmm.Um.So Water Rise for you.We're on three now.Yeah.Well good that you did that. Temple of the Moon, what else.Temple of the Moon, Whispering Garden and Lost Lagoon.Lost Lagoon gone.Ok so.We go.ta.Alright so we have four of these now, we just gotta work on.turning them in.Yeah so you'd probably move there and give that me right?.Give it to you.Yeah.Or shore that up.Move here and give it to you and that's my three turns.Yeah.Yeah.Ah yeah sounds good.Ok.So shore that up.Right here.And then you gotta just.And I gotta get rid of this as well.Yeah I guess we'll just work on it as they come.That would be fine.So and then you need two treasures.Here are three of these here.Iron Gate.Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge.Where's Breaker's Bridge.Iron Gate's gone.Ok.Ta.Um and I also five cards total so I'm going to have to (--) I could.use one of these.to in case we ever need it.Like Temple of the Moon or Helicopter Lift.Ok.Ok.Just lettin' you know.So now it's my turn. I'm going to.Yeah.I'm gonna move here first, so one.Yup.Trade that in, want to discard that for me.And then I have um one more action.Is it worth?.Hmm.Do we need anything?.No I don't think so.Not really ok.Well should we.Oh I have to move there though so.Oh ok.Do you think we.We could.No I think we'll be fine because we have two of these anyway.Ok.Yeah.Ok, so give me two treasure.Three of these ok so I got that back so we have.Copper Gate. Crimson Forest and Howling Garden.You just need.and Copper Gate.So nothing flooded ok.Ta.No and we have four of these now spread out among us all.Ok.Ok.Ok.Hmm.So now it's your turn.Yeah so.I'm gonna unsure up this.Yeah.Should I shore up this so we maintain connectivity?.Hmm.or now I should probably shore up this.Yeah cause then we.Well I could do all of them really.Well yeah cause we can only move on a grid.Yeah and I also only have two out of three or four of these so I can't.So we prob.What do you think.Yeah do you think we should just shore up these other two then?.Necessarily.ta.Um.We could and we have sandbags two. We could shore up a bunch of stuff.Oh why don't yeah use the Sandbag's then.Oh yeah.Yeah.Or maybe you.and then what would she do with her turn then?.Trade cards?.Um.Should I just shore up this one and then move here?.Well she could.Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.If you can you can trade your cards to.She can give them to anyone without being, it just tells us her actions right?.Ah.So each card at.Single card per action. Yes she doesn't have to be with them.And now she has two what?.Yeah so should you just give those to someone?.That's what I was thinking. Probably.Is anyone else closer to.I'm a.Probably me so we can maintain the greens.Yeah.Cause you'll have to.Oh no no no.Yeah not I wouldn't have to and no I'm right there.Yeah you'd have to discard one once I give.And like.Yeah.my fourth one to you.Yeah.But we already also have two yellow so you can just put that there instead.Yeah.should we do that?.That makes sense so.I've done one turn, this will be my second.Or the.Oh yeah the actions.And third that yeah that counts as both right?.Yeah.(--) action.So then you're turn is over so now you need two treasures.Well can I do like a third action just.No cause you already did that one. Cause remember we messed it up each.shore up this?.No the.time you give me a card it counts as a.action.Yeah so you gave her two cards and.But isn't it different since I'm the messenger I can do more than one?.No it just you're not geographically bound.Oh.Yeah.Cause we weren't on the same tile.One actions, I understand ok.I understand.Water Rise.Cliffs of Abandon, Howling Garden and Crimson Forest.This one's Cliffs of Abandon is out.So that's gone.So is Howling Garden. So we gotta protect Whispering Garden if we want that.Mmhmm.Ok.Crimson Forest.Yeah.Well we got Sandbag's so we can.Did you, did we not.move that one? Oh.Or is that one out too or did you already flip that?.I don't.Um.I didn't flip it.You did not?.Ok so that's out too then.No.So all of them are gone ok.By ok.You're turn.Ta.My turn right?.Yeah and you're.Are you.blue?.Yup.Should you move there and give that to me?.That's what I'm thinking.So I can move there for my next turn.Cause it won't get flooded anyways.And one.Yup.turn.So I'll move here as one action.One.two.Two then I have to get rid of this.And then.Should you do anything for your third or?.Um.Cause you can fly.right?.Yeah.If you wanted to for your third, if there was somewhere strategic.I guess I could um.Should we.Should you go here to protect that?.Protect, we should protect one of these because.Yeah.Otherwise I can't get around.Yeah.back to the Fool's.Yeah but we have Helicopter Lifts too, I could fly you.yeah.Ok that's true.Should you.Since we already lost this I should just go here you think?.Yeah might as well right?.For your third one?.And then if that's around I can unshore it next turn or something.yeah.Ok.So now two of those (--).I gotta discard one card.Yeah.Ta I got Breaker's Bridge.That's gone.Whispering Garden.And Temple of the Moon.So this is gone, this gets flipped over and Temple of the Moon gets flipped over too.(--).Ok.(--) sorry.Ok well so I'm gonna do.do one.Trade these in.and now for the third, should I do anything?.The four just in case.Yeah you should probably.When you start.on your.Sandbag this.use these and yeah just to spare it.And I have one more action should I do anything?.I don't really have to.Um, do you want to move closer to Fool's Landing so you're.Oh that's true, might as well take a step forward.Yeah.Oh.So now I need two.(--).Ok well I can maybe even get these (--).Well let's see yeah.Yeah we'll see we have three yellows, three greens, we'll see what, whatever it is.Yeah we'll figure it out. So Copper Gate.Silver Gate and Cave of Embers.Cave of Embers.Silver Gate and.where's Copper Gate?.Gone.Here's that.And these go here.You're turn.Alright.Um.Gonna have to be flying again.Well you might.Should I just.Yeah no I can fly there and then I can fly you.Or well yeah she can fly.Can I.And you could, you could fly her somewhere now right? With an action card.If you needed to.Um.Yeah.Should I just shore up that this time?.(--) I guess it doesn't even matter.Cause you'll be isolated anyways right?.Cause when you go here you can't go diagonally.Yeah.Yeah it depends on if we end up.turning in greens or yellows.Should you shore it up then just to be safe? Yeah.Yeah I guess if you have turns you might as well.Yeah.So that's one.And then two more anything else?.Ten.We don't need that one and then.There are two more actions.I would just.Move right there anyways just because yeah.Oh yeah get closer. Yeah.You could even move on Whispering Garden and then that would be your turn right?.Yeah you could move on.TO be sure yeah that would be three.Mmhmm.Ok.Ok um Bronze Gate, Coral Palace and Dunes of Deception.Where's Coral Palace?.Oh ok.So nothing.Hmm did we do Dunes of Deception?.ta.Yeah we got all three and they're just flooded.Yeah we have four yellows now.Ok.Hmm.So.She just used her turn.So it's your turn.Oh.Oh but we also have four of these too.What if.Oh gotcha, gotcha.Oh ok.So we're kind a.Couldn't be either or.I could well it's your turn next right?.Yeah.And then.Could you use the Helicopter, fly me to the same place as her, I could give her all of those.And then where, where would it be?.Well you could.It's one, oh.Yeah but.Cause I could use my, if I was on the same card as you I could get them all in one turn.But we should probably.protect this because this is going to.Do we have any Sandbags?.Yeah we have one. We could do that.Should we flip that now cause that one's all the way over there right?.We could do that I was thinking cause we have two and two.Or what else.Or what else could we do.Um and we're both already on these and it's my turn.Yeah.I could.Or could you just give those to her?.Give her these two as my two actions.Fly here as my third action and then on my next turn I could use one of these to bring her over here and you'd be there by now.Mmhmm.Oh yeah.Oh perfect ok.Yeah.Yeah that makes sense.You think?.Yeah ok so what do we need to do? It's your turn right?.Yup so.So we're gonna give her those.Yeah and then you.That's two.That's.Two and I have to get rid of.That one.Or get rid of that one, yeah.Just in case so.Well I still.Oh and the Sandbag.And the Sandbags still count. I mean you could use, you could just use the Sandbags if you wanted.Or just get rid of that.Can I.Or no I guess we just save them.Well probably not now cause we already have too many.Yeah get rid of the green one.Yeah ok.So now.And then.you have one more move. Are you gonna do anything? Are you gonna fly yourself?.Yeah so.yeah fly.Yeah.And then two.There you go Misty Marsh.Temple of the Sun.Tidal Palace.Where's Temple of the Sun, oh down here cool, so nothing.Whatever is (--) it's my turn and do I just take my turn going.Mmm ok.To the Landing.Yeah think so.Right.Cause you can fly her to that.Yup.Ok so.Mmhmm.That's two.Oh I got a Water Rise and a Helicopter Lift so.Ok so put that over here, rise that up.This is kind of a whatever shuffle.It's ok.And then we have.Temple of the Moon so that's gone.Um.Whispering Garden.Flip that over and then did you already get Misty Marsh? Is that what you just got?.No that's gone now.Ok.Ok.Now it's your turn.ta.Alright so.(--)so.Hmm.Good.And then.I guess should I just.use this to.Well we could just Helicopter, someone could just Helicopter her there right?.Um.Yeah you could just end your card your turn right now right?.Yeah.Yeah we already have three we just gotta get here and fly you away.Well.But I.But in case.we pick up a flood card and Whispering Garden's (--).Ok yeah it doesn't really matter.Ok yeah it couldn't hurt.On.Undo that.Um I don't really have any other.So now I can use the Helicopter and get her there right? Cause it's a special action?.Yup.So fly that doesn't count as a turn so discard that.and then I could use this right now also cause you can play it at any time right?.Yeah and then we're done right?.Yup sd  b  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  sd  %  b  sd  sd  aa  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  ba  sv  %  b  b  sd  %  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd

Where's the.Yay..Where's our.Water's Rise..That's okay..And.So, not, yeah, okay..We'll take that..Shuffle those.Oh, one, two,.and draw two..Temple of the Moon and Phantom Rock..There's Temple of the Moon..Where's Phantom Rock..Oh, I didn't even see it..It's gone..Oh, lost one already..Alright..Bye..Cool, umm..Now you..I guess I'll just keep my cards for now.unless.you've got two chalice so I'll keep my fire for now..Yeah..Okay, umm where am I, I guess I could shore--.What is this green mean?.That's where the starter piece would be for the.Oh, okay..green guy if he were playing..I see..I'll shore that up.and then I'll.move here because I feel like it,.Mhm..just to hang out with you..Yeah..And.cool..You can give a card.to the fire maybe..Well, well we should just wait to see who has a little bit more of it because we just have one..I think we're gonna, yeah I think we're gonna hold off..That'd mean, yeah I guess..Alright so then I've got.this dude and sandbags..Gold Gate and Lost Lagoon, okay there's Gold Gate, well there's another one..Aw that's sad..And there's Lost Lagoon..Well we don't have any fire right now, oh okay..We're good..Alright, your turn..So,.I don't really have much to do..You could fly to Lost Lagoon and shore it up if you wanted to or you could fly to Breaker's Bridge and shore it up. Then you'd be closer to the center..Yeah..Or you could just walk there,.Maybe I'll do that..doesn't matter..Yeah..So fly.Got choices..then that was one, two.You could also be on the same tile as us in case one of us pulls a great card and wants to give it to somebody..Yeah let's all be on the same one and chill together..Well.also I have this.chalice so maybe just in case..Yeah sure why not. Just hang out there..Alright..Thanks..So then you've got a chalice and a helicopter..Cool..You always getting helicopters..And.I know. I'm lucky I guess..It's the pilot..Oh because you're the pi--.It's good, yeah..Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge, okay. So, this guy.and this guy..Good thing we're all right there..Okay..Do you want to shore those up?.Yeah..That's kinda trippy how she's getting helicopters and she's the pilot..So that's one..So that's one..And then.I can just chill. I'm done..I'm done..Yeah that's fine..We don't need to do anything..I mean.That's true..I can't steal cards so.well just go to you..Yeah..You can move towards the chalice..You might be--.Oh..But then we're, if we're gonna have to give her the chalice cards anyways so she might as well stay close to us, you know?.Yeah..Yeah, you gotta--.I mean or, maybe I'm using the wrong terms this cop thing because you have two so if you move.What--.Yeah.but you would have to give me yours anyways so we just have to wait until that..So you'd have to be on the same tile as her.in order to give her.But I could fly to her.the chalice card..cause we, I have two..We don't need to use your helicopters yet..I think were,.let's just hangout..Yeah we should hangout..So you've got one more chalice. So then you just need to give her that one so that's good..Oop, yay!.And then.And then yeah, pull two of those..Whispering Garden, Iron Gate..There's Whispering Garden, Iron Gate is.There..there, okay..Cool..Alright, um.I guess I'll just hang on to my cards. I don't feel the need to sandbag anything..I mean maybe.Should I go somewhere. Oh actually that's a good call maybe shore that one up because it's important..Oh.yeah..And they are on opposite ends so..Mhm..We're closer to this one. So maybe I'll go there. I don't need to exchange cards with you guys yet..So one two.Yeah..three..Will (--).Oh okay, there was a--.Does that sound good?.Yeah..Okay so you saved the sandbag..Yeah..Yeah..Because we're all, I mean we're pretty close to each other..Yeah. I mean but that one there is still, but he's so far away anyways..Yeah and he doesn't have like a little thingy on him. Okay, so I've got this and Water's Rise okay, so..Yeah..That goes there, this goes here..Now it's Whispering Garden, well thank goodness, Temple of the Moon and Lost Lagoon..There's that and you guys are on that one..Hmm..Okay..So maybe give her that, yeah. So then you gotta discard, maybe discard.So I could do that.Yeah, thank you..(So I can).the fire..Yeah..Turn this ov--.No no no can't I go back..Can we like.maybe I should discard--.Well cause you could give her that one..Because this one is close..I could also give that to you though..But I've got two of these..So I've got a better chance of doing, yeah so you might as well..Oh, yeah..So then, okay so you.So okay, you're going to keep--.I mean we're on that already..Wow, didn't think of it..So I'll do that so that's two..And then you have to get towards a chalice..Then.keep on pulling this..Yeah..Or you can just.You can fly me out there and then I can just give this later..That's what I think, yeah..Just wait..Or should you--.Cause either way so you would have to go one two three, so you wouldn't be able to switch it immediately..Yeah just fly me up..So I think we can fly there for.That's true..Okay so you can just move or stay there, up to you..Yeah fly, fly me up..Well, yeah..Well it's not your turn so you can't. Oh it can be used at anytime, dang okay..Yeah..So,.well I dont know if.Yeah, just--.You can fly both of us, right?.Yeah..Yeah but what am I doing. Oh because actually I can go here and turn this over..It doesn't matter for you..Yeah cause then--.Oh yeah you go chill..I feel like--.But then she could also give you that Earth card..So you have no like real plays left?.Yeah..Okay..So I'm.But.if you, yeah..No it's your turn.If you.just just--.isn't it?.No it's my turn..Or it's your turn, oh my gosh..Just fly me out..So I think I shoud, yeah I think I'll fly.Yeah, just fly out..And then you can stay over here..Well then if I, oh.no cause this isn't an action..Yeah that doesn't even count..Yeah..So I can move here and turn this over..So you gave--.Yeah do that..And that would be a total of three..Oh I thought she didn't have any turns left..Nope she's good..That's three..Okay, awesome..Okay so then you can exchange that. Oh wait you still gotta do that. I'm getting ahead of myself..Okay and then.We're trying to beat our time it looks like..Yeah Breaker's Bridge, Cliffs of Abandon, and Iron Gate. Okay so Iron Gate's gone..Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's.Bridge..Okay..Okay..And then my turn..My turn..Alright..Nice..When--.Already at treasure one..And then I can just shore these two up..Yeah you could move and shore those two up. That would be nice..And then two--.Well.And then you could give her.oh but you're not on the same tile..That was, I think that was more than.That's that cause I can do two (--)..That's one yeah cause she's an Engineer..Oh yeah that's nice..And then.what do I do next. I can give this to her or.You could move on to this, but you have to be on the same tile as her so you could move to the same tile as her and just hangout or you could just wait or you could move some place else,.Oh..I dont think I should do any movement..doesn't matter..Um,.Okay..Um, then I, you pull two cards..(--)..There you go..Temple of the Sun,.Crimson Forest,.Copper Gate..There's Temple of the Sun, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate is there..Okay..Alright..So for my turn.I think.what should I do..Where are you, you're gray..Should I shore, just work on shoring those things up?.Mhm, these? Yeah..And then--.And then should I move towards you guys?.So we can, I can potentially give you this and you can give me that..Well you can hand it to anyone (--)..Oh it's true. Look at me..So you should probably be near this..Okay..Yeah that's true. Okay do I, should I shore up two of those and then.Mhm..give you a card?.Cause you can't give me a card if I'm not close to you. So you would either have to come close to me or I'm gonna have to come close to you..Yeah you can shore. Oh we only have three, okay..Yeah..Shore both of those up and then give one of us a card because.one, at point we're going to have to give cards away, you know..Okay so, shore these up.Yeah..and I think I'll give you the Earth card..I mean who is closer, oh..Yeah give it to her and then I'll give you mine later..(--)..Or you can give.her the.fire..Oh we have more Earth cards in play so I think we should just go with that..One..Yeah, yeah..Okay.and that's my turn..Okay. Chalice and Water's Rise. Super..I feel like it's going up higher.or faster this time..Yeah..Yeah..So it's three..We want Copper Gate,.Temple of the Sun.and Cliffs of Abandon..Temple of the Sun..Why is it so--.That's moon..Cliffs of Abandon..Temple of the Sun, where is it..Oh this is gone..Oh my god..No, I just flipped that..Oh, okay..Oh..Here it is..I see..This is gone..Okay.well that's better than.But we have the other one right there so it's okay..Alright..Cool, so that was my turn..Okay..Well--.Where are you?.You're blue..I'm blue so you could move here and turn this over..Shore--.Yeah..Umm..But if, you should also move towards me if you want to give me this card..So, if I can move.two times.You can also fly..so maybe he--.Oh, that's true..So you could fly to me and then flip that card and not move..Okay..Yeah you can fly over there and flip both of these..Oh that's true because you've got three actions..And then flying isn't even a.a turn so..Yeah it's not a big deal.a.No that is a turn for her..Flying?.That's one.Yeah cause she's not using helicopter card..two, and then.Two and then three with the Copper Gate..Or you could give me that..Doing--.That's true..That might be a better play. To give me a card..But then we might have to go over here.Why don't you use the helicopter card?.though..Well I feel like we should save for the end..We should always save a helicopter, yeah..I think you should give me a card because I think my, the Whisper, I think this guy is our next best bet..Oh yeah..I think so..Yeah..Okay then which one should I discard? Fire or chalice. We already got chalice so that one..Yeah I'd give this one to you..Okay so we have another helicopter.and we have a, so that's good..Okay wow you're so close. That is good..So can I have three..Oh..So Crimson Forest, Lost Lagoon.and Whispering Garden..Crimson Forest is gone..Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden, okay..Yeah..Alright so now it's your turn and if you can get to me that would be super because you have to give me that card..Oh, where am I. Oh here..One, two.here. There's nothing else. You guys. Oh gosh..Alright but are we worried about Whispering Garden dying?.Yeah..I can use my sandbags right now and I'll save it.just in case..Wait I'm not done with my play though..I know but this is an anytime card..Oh yeah. Oh..Nice..Oh..Okay..Oh that's, that was beautiful..Okay..Those are yours..Oh, good..Okay so Temple of the Moon, Breaker's Bridge, Tidal Palace..Um, Tidal Palace.Tidal Palace, Temple of the Moon.and then Breaker's Bridge..right here..Okay..Okay..There..Cool. So I should move here.trade these in.Mhm..and then what else should I do. Move back inwards?.Yeah, I think so..Mhm..Or should I give you, one of you guys a card. Should I give you a card?.Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Because I'm already three fires..Okay..And then I could move over there..Is she closer to Earth. Oh yeah, you're both about the same distance. Okay so I'll give you that..And actually if you move here then you're close to the Fool's Landing..And I can.Yeah that's true too. Oh that would be smart to move here because then you're close to Fool's Landing..and I can clear that--.Oh okay..Even though she has two helicopters so it doesn't really matter. Okay so I'm done..I'm worried about those..Silver Gate,.Dunes of Deception, and Cave of Shadows..Soon, needs to get those..Silver Gate.Dunes of Deception and Cave of Shadows..Oh..Okay. Your turn..So..So I think you should shore some stuff up and focus on her getting to the fire thing..Mhm..Exactly, so.cause we have two so yeah so I'll go here. One, two.So shore this up..So move there.shore up..That's three..Or you could also shore up that..You could just, you could just stay there and shore that and shore that..I think here because then you can come here.You're closer to.get your.get the whatever it's called..I was going to go this way so I could shore that up and then get--.But I think you should come to this one because then you're closer to Fool's Landing..Or yeah..That's true..Yeah, I think I'm done..Wait so that was two plays you did. Three, okay..That was three..That was three..We have so many flooded now..That's okay,a.I think because we're almost there..So if you do.Yeah, oh wow. Yeah..Can only have three..Thank you. I forgot. So I'll get rid of.Oh okay, so you gotta get rid of two. Yeah nobody cares about those..So you can get rid of the cup..Oh okay..Okay. Bronze Gate, Cave of Embers.and Howling Garden..Oh yeah, you have, you still have six..You still have one extra. Yeah just get rid of that.a.Oh I still have six..Okay so Bronze Gate,.Cave of Embers..Oh okay..Bronze Gate, Cave of Embers, and Holwing Garden.So, Cave of Embers..which is there..Okay..So now it's your turn and you should focus on getting here and trading in your cards. So you could do one two three..Oh me..One two.there we go..Awesome..And then I'll take two of those..Can you helicopter me in right.you could helicopter me there right now. You could also helicopter you and her there right now. Oh then we'd need a helicopter to get down. Just kidding..I feel like you..Should you helicopter me in? Yeah. I think that's.You're the furthest..a good use..So I can push you anywhere. Yeah to any other tile..Okay..Yeah let's just helicopter everyone in and then it's like basically over at that point..Okay so then these are two, your two cards..Oh, woah woah, Water Rise's..Oh you have a helicopter lift, okay..That's true. So Water's Rise. So then this goes back here,.Okay..Okay..shuffle these. This could be dangerous. I think we'll be okay..I I think we're going to be okay..And then you can helicopter you and here in right now. And then we just like kinda gloss over my turn. Go through it real fast..I can do that right now?.Yeah..Well.Okay, bye..do we have to do the flood first?.It doesn't matter. I'm just, turn that in..Anytime I guess..One, two.Three, Breaker's--.three. Whispering Garden, Breaker's Bridge is gone.and Lost Lagoon is gone..Oh, hey it looks like it's all won!.Alright so then for my turn I dont want to do anything..Well I guess we could now just leave right..Why we still going?.Yeah let's just go..Oh yeah. We don't even have to go through my turn. Let's get out of here..Okay..Bye..Yay..Okay..Yes! Guys look at that time.

Where's the.Yay.Where's our.Water's Rise.That's okay.And.So, not, yeah, okay.We'll take that.Shuffle those.Oh, one, two,.and draw two.Temple of the Moon and Phantom Rock.There's Temple of the Moon.Where's Phantom Rock.Oh, I didn't even see it.It's gone.Oh, lost one already.Alright.Bye.Cool, umm.Now you.I guess I'll just keep my cards for now.unless.you've got two chalice so I'll keep my fire for now.Yeah.Okay, umm where am I, I guess I could shore--.What is this green mean?.That's where the starter piece would be for the.Oh, okay.green guy if he were playing.I see.I'll shore that up.and then I'll.move here because I feel like it,.Mhm.just to hang out with you.Yeah.And.cool.You can give a card.to the fire maybe.Well, well we should just wait to see who has a little bit more of it because we just have one.I think we're gonna, yeah I think we're gonna hold off.That'd mean, yeah I guess.Alright so then I've got.this dude and sandbags.Gold Gate and Lost Lagoon, okay there's Gold Gate, well there's another one.Aw that's sad.And there's Lost Lagoon.Well we don't have any fire right now, oh okay.We're good.Alright, your turn.So,.I don't really have much to do.You could fly to Lost Lagoon and shore it up if you wanted to or you could fly to Breaker's Bridge and shore it up. Then you'd be closer to the center.Yeah.Or you could just walk there,.Maybe I'll do that.doesn't matter.Yeah.So fly.Got choices.then that was one, two.You could also be on the same tile as us in case one of us pulls a great card and wants to give it to somebody.Yeah let's all be on the same one and chill together.Well.also I have this.chalice so maybe just in case.Yeah sure why not. Just hang out there.Alright.Thanks.So then you've got a chalice and a helicopter.Cool.You always getting helicopters.And.I know. I'm lucky I guess.It's the pilot.Oh because you're the pi--.It's good, yeah.Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge, okay. So, this guy.and this guy.Good thing we're all right there.Okay.Do you want to shore those up?.Yeah.That's kinda trippy how she's getting helicopters and she's the pilot.So that's one.So that's one.And then.I can just chill. I'm done.I'm done.Yeah that's fine.We don't need to do anything.I mean.That's true.I can't steal cards so.well just go to you.Yeah.You can move towards the chalice.You might be--.Oh.But then we're, if we're gonna have to give her the chalice cards anyways so she might as well stay close to us, you know?.Yeah.Yeah, you gotta--.I mean or, maybe I'm using the wrong terms this cop thing because you have two so if you move.What--.Yeah.but you would have to give me yours anyways so we just have to wait until that.So you'd have to be on the same tile as her.in order to give her.But I could fly to her.the chalice card.cause we, I have two.We don't need to use your helicopters yet.I think were,.let's just hangout.Yeah we should hangout.So you've got one more chalice. So then you just need to give her that one so that's good.Oop, yay!.And then.And then yeah, pull two of those.Whispering Garden, Iron Gate.There's Whispering Garden, Iron Gate is.There.there, okay.Cool.Alright, um.I guess I'll just hang on to my cards. I don't feel the need to sandbag anything.I mean maybe.Should I go somewhere. Oh actually that's a good call maybe shore that one up because it's important.Oh.yeah.And they are on opposite ends so.Mhm.We're closer to this one. So maybe I'll go there. I don't need to exchange cards with you guys yet.So one two.Yeah.three.Will (--).Oh okay, there was a--.Does that sound good?.Yeah.Okay so you saved the sandbag.Yeah.Yeah.Because we're all, I mean we're pretty close to each other.Yeah. I mean but that one there is still, but he's so far away anyways.Yeah and he doesn't have like a little thingy on him. Okay, so I've got this and Water's Rise okay, so.Yeah.That goes there, this goes here.Now it's Whispering Garden, well thank goodness, Temple of the Moon and Lost Lagoon.There's that and you guys are on that one.Hmm.Okay.So maybe give her that, yeah. So then you gotta discard, maybe discard.So I could do that.Yeah, thank you.(So I can).the fire.Yeah.Turn this ov--.No no no can't I go back.Can we like.maybe I should discard--.Well cause you could give her that one.Because this one is close.I could also give that to you though.But I've got two of these.So I've got a better chance of doing, yeah so you might as well.Oh, yeah.So then, okay so you.So okay, you're going to keep--.I mean we're on that already.Wow, didn't think of it.So I'll do that so that's two.And then you have to get towards a chalice.Then.keep on pulling this.Yeah.Or you can just.You can fly me out there and then I can just give this later.That's what I think, yeah.Just wait.Or should you--.Cause either way so you would have to go one two three, so you wouldn't be able to switch it immediately.Yeah just fly me up.So I think we can fly there for.That's true.Okay so you can just move or stay there, up to you.Yeah fly, fly me up.Well, yeah.Well it's not your turn so you can't. Oh it can be used at anytime, dang okay.Yeah.So,.well I dont know if.Yeah, just--.You can fly both of us, right?.Yeah.Yeah but what am I doing. Oh because actually I can go here and turn this over.It doesn't matter for you.Yeah cause then--.Oh yeah you go chill.I feel like--.But then she could also give you that Earth card.So you have no like real plays left?.Yeah.Okay.So I'm.But.if you, yeah.No it's your turn.If you.just just--.isn't it?.No it's my turn.Or it's your turn, oh my gosh.Just fly me out.So I think I shoud, yeah I think I'll fly.Yeah, just fly out.And then you can stay over here.Well then if I, oh.no cause this isn't an action.Yeah that doesn't even count.Yeah.So I can move here and turn this over.So you gave--.Yeah do that.And that would be a total of three.Oh I thought she didn't have any turns left.Nope she's good.That's three.Okay, awesome.Okay so then you can exchange that. Oh wait you still gotta do that. I'm getting ahead of myself.Okay and then.We're trying to beat our time it looks like.Yeah Breaker's Bridge, Cliffs of Abandon, and Iron Gate. Okay so Iron Gate's gone.Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's.Bridge.Okay.Okay.And then my turn.My turn.Alright.Nice.When--.Already at treasure one.And then I can just shore these two up.Yeah you could move and shore those two up. That would be nice.And then two--.Well.And then you could give her.oh but you're not on the same tile.That was, I think that was more than.That's that cause I can do two (--).That's one yeah cause she's an Engineer.Oh yeah that's nice.And then.what do I do next. I can give this to her or.You could move on to this, but you have to be on the same tile as her so you could move to the same tile as her and just hangout or you could just wait or you could move some place else,.Oh.I dont think I should do any movement.doesn't matter.Um,.Okay.Um, then I, you pull two cards.(--).There you go.Temple of the Sun,.Crimson Forest,.Copper Gate.There's Temple of the Sun, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate is there.Okay.Alright.So for my turn.I think.what should I do.Where are you, you're gray.Should I shore, just work on shoring those things up?.Mhm, these? Yeah.And then--.And then should I move towards you guys?.So we can, I can potentially give you this and you can give me that.Well you can hand it to anyone (--).Oh it's true. Look at me.So you should probably be near this.Okay.Yeah that's true. Okay do I, should I shore up two of those and then.Mhm.give you a card?.Cause you can't give me a card if I'm not close to you. So you would either have to come close to me or I'm gonna have to come close to you.Yeah you can shore. Oh we only have three, okay.Yeah.Shore both of those up and then give one of us a card because.one, at point we're going to have to give cards away, you know.Okay so, shore these up.Yeah.and I think I'll give you the Earth card.I mean who is closer, oh.Yeah give it to her and then I'll give you mine later.(--).Or you can give.her the.fire.Oh we have more Earth cards in play so I think we should just go with that.One.Yeah, yeah.Okay.and that's my turn.Okay. Chalice and Water's Rise. Super.I feel like it's going up higher.or faster this time.Yeah.Yeah.So it's three.We want Copper Gate,.Temple of the Sun.and Cliffs of Abandon.Temple of the Sun.Why is it so--.That's moon.Cliffs of Abandon.Temple of the Sun, where is it.Oh this is gone.Oh my god.No, I just flipped that.Oh, okay.Oh.Here it is.I see.This is gone.Okay.well that's better than.But we have the other one right there so it's okay.Alright.Cool, so that was my turn.Okay.Well--.Where are you?.You're blue.I'm blue so you could move here and turn this over.Shore--.Yeah.Umm.But if, you should also move towards me if you want to give me this card.So, if I can move.two times.You can also fly.so maybe he--.Oh, that's true.So you could fly to me and then flip that card and not move.Okay.Yeah you can fly over there and flip both of these.Oh that's true because you've got three actions.And then flying isn't even a.a turn so.Yeah it's not a big deal.a.No that is a turn for her.Flying?.That's one.Yeah cause she's not using helicopter card.two, and then.Two and then three with the Copper Gate.Or you could give me that.Doing--.That's true.That might be a better play. To give me a card.But then we might have to go over here.Why don't you use the helicopter card?.though.Well I feel like we should save for the end.We should always save a helicopter, yeah.I think you should give me a card because I think my, the Whisper, I think this guy is our next best bet.Oh yeah.I think so.Yeah.Okay then which one should I discard? Fire or chalice. We already got chalice so that one.Yeah I'd give this one to you.Okay so we have another helicopter.and we have a, so that's good.Okay wow you're so close. That is good.So can I have three.Oh.So Crimson Forest, Lost Lagoon.and Whispering Garden.Crimson Forest is gone.Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden, okay.Yeah.Alright so now it's your turn and if you can get to me that would be super because you have to give me that card.Oh, where am I. Oh here.One, two.here. There's nothing else. You guys. Oh gosh.Alright but are we worried about Whispering Garden dying?.Yeah.I can use my sandbags right now and I'll save it.just in case.Wait I'm not done with my play though.I know but this is an anytime card.Oh yeah. Oh.Nice.Oh.Okay.Oh that's, that was beautiful.Okay.Those are yours.Oh, good.Okay so Temple of the Moon, Breaker's Bridge, Tidal Palace.Um, Tidal Palace.Tidal Palace, Temple of the Moon.and then Breaker's Bridge.right here.Okay.Okay.There.Cool. So I should move here.trade these in.Mhm.and then what else should I do. Move back inwards?.Yeah, I think so.Mhm.Or should I give you, one of you guys a card. Should I give you a card?.Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Because I'm already three fires.Okay.And then I could move over there.Is she closer to Earth. Oh yeah, you're both about the same distance. Okay so I'll give you that.And actually if you move here then you're close to the Fool's Landing.And I can.Yeah that's true too. Oh that would be smart to move here because then you're close to Fool's Landing.and I can clear that--.Oh okay.Even though she has two helicopters so it doesn't really matter. Okay so I'm done.I'm worried about those.Silver Gate,.Dunes of Deception, and Cave of Shadows.Soon, needs to get those.Silver Gate.Dunes of Deception and Cave of Shadows.Oh.Okay. Your turn.So.So I think you should shore some stuff up and focus on her getting to the fire thing.Mhm.Exactly, so.cause we have two so yeah so I'll go here. One, two.So shore this up.So move there.shore up.That's three.Or you could also shore up that.You could just, you could just stay there and shore that and shore that.I think here because then you can come here.You're closer to.get your.get the whatever it's called.I was going to go this way so I could shore that up and then get--.But I think you should come to this one because then you're closer to Fool's Landing.Or yeah.That's true.Yeah, I think I'm done.Wait so that was two plays you did.

And then there's the Earth, so it's better for him to keep the Earth becuase he's close to it..It's right here. Right here and there..Mmhmm..Yeah.Ok..Hmm.Mmhmm.(--).Mmhmm.So I'd discard the ocean.and I'd give him this..Yeah, that sounds good..Uh..Mmhmm..And then, wait what color are you?.So I get that..I'm grey..Ok, gotcha. I keep.She's grey..messing this up. Then do you wanna.Um..That's one action..That's wh-.And then I'm here..Oh..Yeah, probably wanna save Whispering Garden..Whispering- Yeah..Uh yeah, that's one, two,.Yeah..three..(--), good..Perfect..Ok..Um, alright..And then, two of these..Yeah..Ok, so I'm stacked with the Sandbags..Nice, nice..Hmm..Um, and then,.Good..one, two,.three..Iron Gate's gone..Temple of the Moon.and Breaker's Bridge..So we're gonna have to-.You know I can Sandbag Temple of the Moon right now, or should we save it?.I can- Oh, well..Uh, well I guess I'm up next.

Alright..(The fourth)..Mmhmm..Yeah, you probably save it for now and then-.Yeah..Flip that, move here, flip that..Yeah..That's two..Ok..Alright..Cool..Ok..(--)..Ok, that's good. Ah and then would you mind handing me three of those?.Huh? Oh, (--)..Here you go..Thanks..Temple of the Sun, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate..Uh, Sun,.Yeah I meant Copper..Copper..Ok..This- Ok, wait, wait, wait..Oh, five cards. You have way more than five cards..Yeah, I do. Good looking out. Uh, so-.Yeah. Alright, um keep the Helicopter Lifts..You're, yeah, you're about to give him this guy so might as well toss that- One, two, three, four, five, then we're good..Two, four, six..Yeah, so get rid of that..That's five..Ok. Two, four, five..Alright..Five..Ok, cool..Ok..Alright..We'll snatch them up..Alright, so.(Safe)..Let's see..So, for now you just wanna hang out by Whispering.(--)..Garden..Yeah, you can save Copper Gate and Crimson Forest, and then move to Whispering Garden..Uh..But.Uh..Uh..Yeah..Mmhmm..Now just save those and then.hopefully next time-.Yeah..That should work..Cause then by the time it gets around I can.One, two, three..Uh huh..Uh huh..pass him the last card..You need two of these.Uh, alright..Let's see, oh no..Oh jeez..Well.and you need to get rid of one of those cards. I'd get rid of the Ocean's chalice again..that one..Mmhmm..Yeah..Yeah..Uh..Yeah..I wonder how many I have..Oh..And then.(--)..I'll move that up..(Chalice)..So then three of these..Ok..And take three..(Mmhmm)..Three of those..We have to uh, we got Water's Rising right?.Yeah, I always forget that..Yeah..Yeah, so shuffle those back in. I got that guy..Yeah..You got it?.Yeah we moved it over..Yeah..Ok..So do you have.Cliffs of Abandon, yup..Whispering Garden..You can still collect the treasure once it's sunk, as far as I'm concerned..Mmhmm..Uh huh..(--)..Yeah, I think so..Uh huh..And Crimson Forest..Crimson Forest is right next to it..Crimson Forest..There we go..Cool..Ok..Alright..Yeah..Ok..Thanks..Ok..Then.Then,(yeah he's drawn) ok..My turn..(--).What do I wanna do? I was gonna give this away..But then he'd be over..But,.but I have to wait until next turn..Yeah..Uh yeah, didn't think about that..Uh..I can hang out with-.Um, ok..I mean you can pass it to me. That's the only person you can pass it to right now..That's true..That's true..Yeah, and then she could pass for both of them..And, yeah..Oh, cool..Pass both over..Ah no, he still couldn't (--) take both..Hmm..(--) messed this up..Wait, well his focus is the wind statue right now..Uh..(--)..But.(--)..I could pass both of these..(--)..Uh..That's two and then I can use my- Oh I can't use my special thing..I can.get this guy..I can get both of these..That's my supwerpower with one, then I can pass these two to you..Hmm..That's two..And then you can.probably pass them over there..Uh, yeah. If I can use them..Uh I don't know how- Well, you can use them, I don't know. No?.Yeah..Well, I don't- No..I-.No, well, yeah..Hm, yeah I guess it's be- It's probably best for you to have them anyway..Uh, or this, which-.Yeah, that would work..Yeah cause you can give them away easiest..Because yeah you have the easiest way of moving around..Yeah..True..Which, which should I pass..Which two? Where am I?.Uh, it really doesn't, doesn't matter..Yup..Well, you and I, you and I are right here..It really doesn't matter because I'm couple spaces from everything. I'd say the fire.Yeah..stone..Ok..Ok, so one, two.And I'll flip these guys back over..Cool..Three..And then I can take two more..(Well).Only (--)..give a single card. Oh, yeah, I knew there was something..Ok, pass these back..Ah..Alright, that makes more sense..Yeah, but I used two actions..Yeah, um.You can use the same action twice?.Oh yeah..Nah..Ok..(You're fine?) Ok..Oh, ok. Cool..Ok..Alright..Helicopter Lift..Alright..ALright..Nice, ok..(--)..That's cool, that's a good.amount. And then, three..Ok. One, two, three, four, five. Just making sure..Copper Gate,.Copper Gate, that's Silver, that's Copper..(--)..Breaker's Bridge,.And it's gone. No!.Ok, and then, there you go. And then Temple of the Moon. So..Ok, we gotta keep our eye on that..Yeah, we gotta watch these..Cause both Temple of the Sun and the Moon are uh.Mmhmm..Mmhmm..in grave danger. Yeah, I think I'm gonna Sandbag.Might wanna Sandbag sometime..this one. Cause that one's all the way in the corner. We're not gonna get to that..Yeah..Yeah, we've never really been over there..Wait, wait, wait, wait..Oh I guess they're both in the- in this thing, so..Right? They're both in here?.Yeah..No, they're not both in here..Only Temple of the Moon's in here..Ah this must have started off like that.So it might be-.Is it better to do that then? Because this is going to be.Ah.It's all the way in the cornern. it may be like, repeated, but like-.Pilot did..Yeah, actually that's a good point. I could always get there in one move..True..Mmhmm..And we can just sacrifice that..I- Yeah..I think it might be better to.do that one.because this is gonna.Yeah..possibility to.Ok..come back (more)..(--), it'll keep coming back everytime, we'll have to save it..Yeah, yeah..Alright..Yeah, that's a good thought..Ok.that makes sense..So I'm gonna Sandbag that..Ok, so,.my turn right?.Yes, and you- Yeah..Ok,.Mmhmm..my first move is-.And then you get rid of one of the Earth Stone cards..Uh huh..Ok..Great..Cool..And then.thats one,.two, three. You have to get rid of.Uh, yeah, which one would I wanna get, get rid of? One, two,.I don't know if that's a good idea..Hmm, no it is..Um,.Hmm..I guess I.He's stuck with the Earth Stone..couldn't use them right away..You're stuck with both of those..Well,.I won't be able to us it.until it gets back to you again,.so you'll have the option of giving them to me if someone else picks up one of the Fire's next time,.and then I would have all four right on that turn. So there's like no real benefit to doing it on this turn..Yup..We already discarded like two of these ones though..Yeah, that's what I figured..So, there's probably more of these in the deck..Yeah..Mmhmm..Hmm..Ok,.Hmm..so then,.yeah..Well, I mean I can hold on to all of them for right now..Oh, ok..Yeah..So what's, what's the move?.Uh, where are you right now?

Can you pass me two please?.Ok.(No).(Yeah).Thanks. Oh, this is the same thing. These- This deck is stacked.Already?.Oh boy.Ha.Rigged.Stacked against us.So,.but now we shuffle these.Shuffle those.(--).I'll take that.You can take that.We're learning the rules a lot faster too.

Yeah.Um.Well, I think-.I don't know yet, may- But you can't- You should go somewhere where you can.Maybe.(--).get something from someone maybe.True.Yeah.Um.Well yeah, and I could save Cliffs of Abandon.I'll just.pass, yeah.Yeah, that's probably better.Yeah, that's probably a good idea.So,.if I move to Temple of the Moon,.save Cliffs of Abandon,.Mmhmm.Hmm.and then.I got.What- Who's-.these two-.Um.I could.start getting these.Yeah.The fire ones maybe.I guess, yeah.I could-.You could (gift) that over here since you're there and then maybe get easier on your special power to give the um,.Well, yeah.the (win) one over here.I'm on my last move though.Have you moved twice at this point?.But you could special (--).So, ye- Yes, cause I shore, cause I fixed this. So, if I start here, so instead of moving twice, so-.Does it ask?.You,.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.you started-.Oh ok. Ok.Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.I shore- I shored up.that. So now I have two moves and then I can-.Mmhmm.Ok, so then I can give you that.Uh, but you can only do that once, right?.I (--)-.No, no I can. Remember? You're the one that told me that I could, yeah.Uh, (anyone).(--).That's your third move, right?.But you have,.Yeah, that's my third move.you have to be um,.I don't.actually touching. Or you can do that as many times with your special action.I can do that anywhere.Anywhere, as many times. That's what we did last time.Anywhere (in the island for what) (--). Ok, yeah, cool.Is it?.Ok.Mmhmm.Alright, now I take two.(Nope).Uh, alright.Works for me.Just do it.Yeah.Sandbags and wind.This is definitely the exact same cards.Hmm.Alright.Ok, and then,.Yeah.(--).(--).One, two,.Dun, dun, dun, dun. Oh no.Temple of the Moon,.and,.Breaker's Bridge.Where's that?.Right below it.Alright.Ok.Alright, it's your turn. So,.Uh, let's see.Where's the other- Ok, Temple of the Sun's over there.(--) Fool's Landing, (what do you have)?.Uh, this.Earth Stone.If I were to go over here, kind of with you guys, I could save these two.You-.Yeah.Yeah.That would be all three.Yeah, you could get all three.Think of anything else?.Yeah.Oh, yeah.I think that's everything here.Yup.(--).Um.(--) the Helictoper.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.Hmm.But, if you wanna, (we'll come at your blue).Hmm, I'm blue yeah.Yeah.Yeah, yeah, never mind.It's, it's spread out differently. So the best move would probably would be for him to head to.Yeah.Oh.Whispering Garden.He can, he can leave it there. You have to take up to three.(--).True.Yeah.Mmhmm, that's true. And then you can send that over the next turn and then he'd- Ah, he'd still need one more.Yeah, so,.Uh.(--).You could go one,.and just.pick that up.Two, save that.Uh huh.Hmm.And then, um, he could come back up this way (anyway).Just to save it, I mean instead of just.Yeah, that's true, yeah.playing one, one,.True.True.thing.One.Yeah.Yeah.(--) sounds right.(--).Yeah. No, no, not that one. So move here and then we're gonna.Not that one.flip this one.Save the, Breaker's Bridge.If that's okay with you.Yeah, sure.Ok.Yeah.And just so we can walk around.Ok.That's smart.Uh huh.And then uh if you wanted to move back up towards Whispering Garden.Uh.So you can move to Misty Marsh, so then you'd be.Right.kinda close.Yeah.Mmhmm.Cause we're trying to stack you up with the wind statues.Alright.Yeah.So you can take it.Alright.Mmhmm.So that's three there.Hmm.Alright.Alright, cool.Great, (I need these) (--).Mmhmm.(Here you go).Uh, so Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.Oh oh.Alright.Uh oh, ok.Ok.That's ok.

Yeah they're like right next to each other (--) you can redeem them so.Yeah, so,.Yeah.you might as well be the one to do it.Hmm.I should probably save that real quick so.Yeah, save Whispering Garden.Mmhmm.No, one, two, three.That's two.Three.Ok, can you pass me two please?.Alright. Mmhmm.Two- Ok.(--).Uh.It's you, everytime, it's you.Uh yeah.They're stacked, this is the exact same things.Alright.I guess that's what makes it a study.Um, one.Oh we gotta flip those on top first.Shoot, yeah, yup, yup, yup.And then, you're doing ok with cards?

Yup, cool.And shuffle up.Two, four, five.Yeah.(--).(A green).Oh.Oh.We can do that next time.Um,.three.Whispering Garden.Well, um, good thing you saved it.(--).Yeah.Cliffs of Abandon.This one gets hit the hardest.Yeah.It's always in the middle too.Lost Lagoon is gone.We lost the Lost lagoon.(--), can't find it.Alright.No you're up.Ok.Ok.So,.Um.(--).Do you wanna, give that away, perhaps?.Yes.That would be good.(Let's).Are you- What color are you?.But he has to discard a card. I'm.That's true, um.grey.So, he could discard.Hmm.the-.Hmm.Yeah.I'd say the ocean.Uh.(--) chalice.(Ch).No.Yeah.I think.Um, that-.(You think).Oh.I'm just trying to see where, where to redeem this.Cause, cause I can give this my-.Ocean, ocean.(Where's uh).Right there. And then there's the Earth, so it's better for him to keep the Earth becuase he's close to it.It's right here. Right here and there.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.Hmm.Mmhmm.(--).Mmhmm.So I'd discard the ocean.and I'd give him this.Yeah, that sounds good.Uh.Mmhmm.And then, wait what color are you?.So I get that.I'm grey.Ok, gotcha. I keep.She's grey.messing this up. Then do you wanna.Um.That's one action.That's wh-.And then I'm here.Oh.Yeah, probably wanna save Whispering Garden.Whispering- Yeah.Uh yeah, that's one, two,.Yeah.three.(--), good.Perfect.Ok.Um, alright.And then, two of these.Yeah.Ok, so I'm stacked with the Sandbags.Nice, nice.Hmm.Um, and then,.Good.one, two,.three.Iron Gate's gone.Temple of the Moon.and Breaker's Bridge.So we're gonna have to-.You know I can Sandbag Temple of the Moon right now, or should we save it?.I can- Oh, well.Uh, well I guess I'm up next.

No?.Yeah.Well, I don't- No.I-.No, well, yeah.Hm, yeah I guess it's be- It's probably best for you to have them anyway.Uh, or this, which-.Yeah, that would work.Yeah cause you can give them away easiest.Because yeah you have the easiest way of moving around.Yeah.True.Which, which should I pass.Which two? Where am I?.Uh, it really doesn't, doesn't matter.Yup.Well, you and I, you and I are right here.It really doesn't matter because I'm couple spaces from everything. I'd say the fire.Yeah.stone.Ok.Ok, so one, two.And I'll flip these guys back over.Cool.Three.And then I can take two more.(Well).Only (--).give a single card. Oh, yeah, I knew there was something.Ok, pass these back.Ah.Alright, that makes more sense.Yeah, but I used two actions.Yeah, um.You can use the same action twice?.Oh yeah.Nah.Ok.(You're fine?) Ok.Oh, ok. Cool.Ok.Alright.Helicopter Lift.Alright.ALright.Nice, ok.(--).That's cool, that's a good.amount. And then, three.Ok. One, two, three, four, five. Just making sure.Copper Gate,.Copper Gate, that's Silver, that's Copper.(--).Breaker's Bridge,.And it's gone. No!.Ok, and then, there you go. And then Temple of the Moon. So.Ok, we gotta keep our eye on that.Yeah, we gotta watch these.Cause both Temple of the Sun and the Moon are uh.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.in grave danger. Yeah, I think I'm gonna Sandbag.Might wanna Sandbag sometime.this one. Cause that one's all the way in the corner. We're not gonna get to that.Yeah.Yeah, we've never really been over there.Wait, wait, wait, wait.Oh I guess they're both in the- in this thing, so.Right? They're both in here?.Yeah.No, they're not both in here.Only Temple of the Moon's in here.Ah this must have started off like that.So it might be-.Is it better to do that then? Because this is going to be.Ah.It's all the way in the cornern. it may be like, repeated, but like-.Pilot did.Yeah, actually that's a good point. I could always get there in one move.True.Mmhmm.And we can just sacrifice that.I- Yeah.I think it might be better to.do that one.because this is gonna.Yeah.possibility to.Ok.come back (more).(--), it'll keep coming back everytime, we'll have to save it.Yeah, yeah.Alright.Yeah, that's a good thought.Ok.that makes sense.So I'm gonna Sandbag that.Ok, so,.my turn right?.Yes, and you- Yeah.Ok,.Mmhmm.my first move is-.And then you get rid of one of the Earth Stone cards.Uh huh.Ok.Great.Cool.And then.thats one,.two, three. You have to get rid of.Uh, yeah, which one would I wanna get, get rid of? One, two,.I don't know if that's a good idea.Hmm, no it is.Um,.Hmm.I guess I.He's stuck with the Earth Stone.couldn't use them right away.You're stuck with both of those.Well,.I won't be able to us it.until it gets back to you again,.so you'll have the option of giving them to me if someone else picks up one of the Fire's next time,.and then I would have all four right on that turn. So there's like no real benefit to doing it on this turn.Yup.We already discarded like two of these ones though.Yeah, that's what I figured.So, there's probably more of these in the deck.Yeah.Mmhmm.Hmm.Ok,.Hmm.so then,.yeah.Well, I mean I can hold on to all of them for right now.Oh, ok.Yeah.So what's, what's the move?.Uh, where are you right now? You're right here.Uh, you wanna just.I could.save those two, I guess? You haven't made any moves right?.(--).Copper and- Oh well.Yeah, well, I made one. I handed him this card.Oh, right, ok.So, if I move to Cliffs of Abandon I could-.Oh, I don't know, are we still working on saving Temple of the Moon.Why not?.I mean,.I don't, I don't see why not either,.Uh, yeah.because.Go for it.yeah.Well, I mean, the less that we have.to lose, the better.Yeah, and that way I won't necessarily have to be the one to.redeem them, (well) that particular one.Mmhmm.Exactly.Then, get those things.And then.(--).Awesome.Oh my god.Wow.That-.Alright.And then (choose).Sweet.Ok.Cool.Ok.,.Tidal Palace,.Temple of the Sun,.and Silver Gate.Ok.(--), alright.Ok.Didn't lose any.Hmm.(--).So what are you up to?.Um, ok.Um, this is useless,.this I can, I can give both of these-.Ah, not both, I can give.Nnhmm.You coudl give me one of these.You'd have to get rid of something though. You could get rid (--).I'd get rid of this guy,.and then, cause we already have those two,.Um, oh ok.I see.and then you can pass me this one.One, two, three, yeah, ok.(--).Uh.Um, ok.So, (--).I am red.You're red.Alright.I guess I can fly back.(--).(--).and discard this.Thank you.(--), that's two, and then.I guess, save-.Do you wanna save something? Yeah.Yeah this one could give us more access to everything else.(--), they wanna be (flying --).Um.What's.if you wanna fly me over to Cave of Embers or Cave of Shadows and then I can get that done.Oh yeah, cause you can do that immediately.Yeah, let's do that.Uh, right here.(--).Ok.cool.Great.Oh can we do that at any point or does it have to be your turn?.That's if you use the Helicopter Lift.You can-.Right, but to redeem them that's an action.Oh, that might have to be on your turn.Hmm.Um.Um, sure, yeah to, to give-.(--) capture a treasure it has to be an action.Oh, has to be (--).Do you wanna.not use the Helicopter yet then?.Ok.Um, it doesn't really matter yet, you might as well wait.Cause then if it's on your turn you could just move.(--).Yeah.Do it.Yeah.Um, ok.Alright.So, I'm set then. Oh I guess I'm gonna have to give up a card anyway though.Ok.That makes sense.Uh,.so you wanna do it?.You can give up this one.Uh, we don't wanna give up too many (--).Well, cause we.Um.you don't- You give up the fire card.Oh yeah, yeah, good, ok.First of all-.Oh yeah, true, true.

Okay..So, I think last time what I did was I moved and then I shored up two pieces..Mhm..Umm.actually I can shore up.all three because one.two and then.Oh.three..true true true..Nice..Dang.right off the bat..Yes. Okay um so now I have to draw two of those..Nice..Okay, cool..Aw man..Dang it. Okay, um..I'll move this up,.I'll fold this.right here and then.two..Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge..Good thing I just.Yeah..shored those up..Okay..Oh that would have been bad..Okay..So we're good..Cool. Alright so my turn..Umm, any suggestions for me right now? I have three different like treasure cards..Mhm..Um,.not much else going for me right now..Umm should I just try to move to like the center area of the board?a.Umm..Okay..Umm.you could.shore something up.I don't know if that is of importance but.Cliffs of Abandon..you don't have anything else to do..Yeah..So,.one.and then.you gotta put that over there. Yeah we forgot to do that..Oh, right. Yeah..Yeah..Okay..Um, so I made one move.I can--.You can.Do we want to start collecting.trade..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah that would work..Okay, so..Let me give you this chalice.and then let me shore up.Cliffs of Abandon..So I think, is that three?.That was three..Yeah..Yeah..Alright..So two treasure--.Alright cool..Nice..Alright, sandbags.and then two Whispering Gardens and the Gold Gate..So Gold Gate is gone..Oh no that was fast..Yeah..Alright and then Whispering Garden.Here it is..Okay..That was very good to help me uh.shore them up. Okay..Damn..Alright..Alright, um..So.I guess you'll probably spend your next turn like shoring stuff up..Yeah..Um..You could shore that one up..Do we need this though?.Unless.I mean no not really..The, the cards on the outside I feel like we don't really need..Okay..Um.you have two fires.two chalices and you have two.Earths..Two, yeah..Okay..So.I don't, you don't have to do anything..Okay..That's fine..Is there, I mean I might as well shore something up..Yeah I mean if you want to shore up Breaker's Bridge..You can--.I could fly here and shore those two up..Yeah..Yeah..Okay..Okay..Cool..Okay. One helicopter and more fire..(--) two of these..Thank you..Phantom Rock.Gone..done..The Lost Lagoon.also done..Well..That's (--)..No, that's fine..Okay..Alright cool..My turn..Yes..Mhm..Okay..Um.well I could start moving towards the fire thing.and then like.you could start--.Then you'll be at fire and chalice..Yeah..Because.I if I take, if I get another fire card.And I give you this one.then you give me that one. Then you could go fly over here and give that to me on your turn..Mhm..That sounds good..So I'll start doing that so.one.two.three..Perfect..Okay, cool..Then.Yes! I got a fire card, okay..Yay..Sweet..But I have to give one up..I'll give.this up..Yeah so I'm gonna.Okay..Yeah I think we'll go chalice, earth, fire..(--)..Wait.can you.did you just draw this card?.Yeah..Can you.okay why do I think that's five..I think you can discard it..Yeah..Okay.so.two..Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate..Okay..Alright, sweet..So,.recommendations for me?.Because I have Earth cards..Should I just shore that up..Shore.mhm..Yeah..Okay..And then you could like.just go there maybe and then.if one of us draws an Earth card then you'll already be there.Okay..and we could give it to you..Alright.sounds good..Um.I guess that's all I really want to do..Okay..Okay..Oh no we're at three..Okay, we're in whatever.don't like this Forbidden Island, okay..Breaker's Bridge,.Cliffs of Abandon.and then Whispering Garden..Here..Okay. Oh jeeze..Okay..Didn't we already do that?.I only took one..Oh you only took one okay yeah Water's Rise..Alright, okay..Cool so we have five cards..And then you get rid of the Water's Rises..Yes okay so I have four..Okay, um.Cool..alright so I'm the blue guy, um.I think what I'll do is shore up the Whispering Garden's then move here and give you the fire..That works yeah that'll be perfect..Okay..Awesome.Oh but I have to get rid of this..Okay..I think one of the, yeah..Yeah..That's fine..Okay..Okay..Okay..Anything else?.Oh wait that was three, okay..No yeah, you're done..Sandbags and.Earth..Earth..So I'll make sure to give that to you at some point..And I guess that's it..Thank you..The Howling Garden,.the Iron Gate.Gone..Oh no..and the Temple of the Moon..Okay..Okay..So it's my turn..Mhm..Okay..Nice..Alright..One.um.I'm here.Mhm..I could do.two.three..That sounds good..Cool..Okay so we have.four..Would it be best if--.Oh.we now have four Earth's..Yes okay and then.Yeah..three flood cards..Cave of Embers.Copper Gate and Crimson Forest..So Cave of Embers--.Okay..Alright so, I'm going to shore up this..Alright so that's one. Would it be best if I came down here.towards like the Temple of the Sun since you all are like in this general area..Um.I don't know..I think you could.if you, cause if you started going over here you'd have to, it would take you at least two turns..Yeah.so just.And if she gives you her card during one of.her turns and I give you mine, by the next time you'll have enough..Okay..Yeah okay. Alright sounds good..So then I guess.I mean for the sake of having, just like.More tiles,.yeah, more tiles. Alright..yeah..Alright, okay..So that's it for me, my like two cards here..So uh.But you have to get rid of one. Well the Water's Rise.Yeah..So you can do that now..Oh, god..I think our board looks okay for the most part..Yeah agreed,.mostly non flooded..Okay..So uh.two.three.Well we lost the Howling Garden..Okay..Oh no..Oh god, okay. The Cliffs of Abandon..Where is that..Right here..Oh..Oh okay..Okay..Alright..And Breaker's Bridge. So Breaker's Birdge is gone..Oh man..Okay, alright..And then this gets discarded..Okay..Okay, um.so I will fly over to you.Okay..and give you my Earth card..Okay..So--.Or if you'd prefer, I could fly you down to the Temple of the Sun..What you could do.is you coud, where are you?.I'm here..You're here..You could move here for one.I'm here..and then fly both of us with oh you're here so you can move here for one.and then use your helicopter card to fly both of us here.Okay..So then you can, for the third.whatever action, you can give him your card..Okay..And then I can give him my card because I'll be on the same tile as him..And then what will you do with your two extra turns?.Uhh.You could move here and shore both of those up..Yeah I could do that and then by that time he'll, he'll be here so he'll be able to get this..Okay..Or that thing, whatever..Another option would be to take the helicopter lift.fly him over here and then we're all like in the same little area.to be able to give each other anything..Yeah I mean that wouldn't be a bad idea since we do have like.all three.like treasures right here..Um.But we already have this one..True..Yeah so we just need to focus on like.these two I guess..Yeah that's true, yeah..And.since we don't have much of a.Okay..Well we have the same number of lions as we do chalices..Oh yeah yeah yeah. Yeah..So we'll just see how the cards play..Where is the other lion card? Okay the other lions there so that's kinda halfway..Yeah..Okay..So what do we want to do..I'm open to either one..Um how many turns would it take if we did that? Because.you--.If I flew him there?.Yeah.So that's free.and then I would spend one giving this to him.Oh then you'd have to.spend more turns.Yeah..getting over to him..Yeah..Okay so let's just go with yours then..Okay so you would.you're.the.this one..Yes..Yeah..So you would go.Fly here.no wait no you would go here.and then you would fly both of us to here..Okay..And then.you would give him.that..Cool..So that was two.And then I have to get rid of one. I'm going to get rid of this one..Yeah..That was two moves cause one.and then that didn't count and then I gave it to him so I have one more move..Okay..You could.well if you already have one of the lion ones, you could start moving here..Okay..True..And then.Another helicopter and oh another lion..Nice..That worked out perfectly..Yeah..Okay the Copper Gate.gone..Oh man.Uh oh..Crimson Forest.and the Whispering Garden's..Oh god..Oh we can't lose this one..It's gonna be okay..Well we have this, we have two sandbags so we could.Yeah..Yeah..Okay.Mhm..so it's my turn..Mhm..Mhm..So I'm going to give this to you..Alright, cool..So you have to.get rid of something.Should I get rid of the.sandbag?.Um--.Probably.this.sandbag maybe. Cause if you're collecting the lion..Mhm..Mhm..Okay,.that was one move..Um.oh I can do, which.color am I?.Red..I can do.one, oh no, wait..One.two.and shore that up..Mine?.Wouldn't that already be three moves?.No..Oh right..You could move to the Misty Marsh and shore up Cliffs of Abandon..No because if I move here.and then I can shore this up..But you already gave him something..Yeah so that'll be three because I don't, I don't have to be standing on this to shore it up..Oh oh I thought you were going to shore up both. Yeah, go ahead..No..Yeah I mean unless you guys have other suggestions..No that works..Okay..Okay, alright..So two..Alright so a chalice. Oh..Oh nice. Oh..Oh. That changes things, okay..That would--.Game changer..That worked out very well..So.three..Okay..Cave of.Forget about that..Not today..Embers..Wait..Temple--.Wait you flip that back over?.Oh wait..That's gone..Oh yeah it's gone then. Okay..Temple of the Moon,.flip this over,.Oh god. Okay..We already used that though..and Silver Gate..Okie doke..Okay..Sinking fast..Okay cool alright so I'm going to cash in.on this..Woo.(get that old thing)..Alright so that's one move um and then.I'm going to.give you.Well you guys have to be, are you on the same, yeah..No..No this is like, my power is like I'm a messenger so I'll give you that..He's the messenger..Oh, right..Okay..And then I have to throw something away..Would one helicopter lift like be okay?.Yeah probably..Because I feel like I would keep the sandbag just because like.Mhm if the Whisp--.If we want to keep Whispering Garden's really..Well either the Whispering Garden's or the Coral Palace..Yeah, whatever works..Mhm..Okay..Okay..Alright..So.then I have to draw two cards right?.Okay so another chalice..Okay alright another one of these and then.three of these..So Dunes of Deception,.Coral Palace.okay.and the Bronze Gate..Okay..The Bronze--.Bronze Gate..Okay..So we got to save the Coral Palace..Yeah what I think I'll do is.move here and dry both of those..Yeah, that's good..Okay..Okay..Nice..Okay..And then oh I could dry one more thing..No but you already did.(--) doesn't count as an action..three..Oh, right right..Is there anything else we want dry?.Can you go like anywhere on the uh board?.I already used my actions..Oh okay alright..Well I suppose I could take one of these back.use the sandbag on it.and then have one more action..Oh yeah true..But there's no where I really need to be.Yeah..Nah..and I don't need to give anyone anything..You could just save it in case we need it..Oh..Okay.Okay..cool..Sweet..Alright more chalices and more fire. I'll just throw out the fire..Okay..And.Oh but you still have too many cards..I still have too many cards, okay. I will throw out.the last chalice..Yeah we don't need it..Sounds good..Okay and could you pull flood cards please..Yes..Here you go..Thank you..Okay, Temple of the Sun,.the Tidal Palace,.Tidal Palace..the Misty Marsh..Oh..Get back fast..Okay..Yeah exactly..Alright.sweet..Okay.so I'm this one..Mhm..Yes..So.one.two.and then three..Boom.nice..Sweet..So we have three treasures..Now we just have to make it back to Fool's Landing..And then I have to get two of those..Yes..Okay I really hope it's not a flood card..Oh..Oh..Water's Rise so.move this up..Oh my god..As long as we don't pull both the Temple of the Moon and the Misty Marsh..Yeah..Uh oh..But would we even need it because we just have to get back here..But he'd drown..But like I'll drown and that's game over..But you can swim, oh I see what you mean. Okay..Oh god..Shuffle.Shuffle this good..Well could he swim here?.But there's nothing connected to it..Yeah so I'd be trapped..You'd be stuck there..Yeah..Okay,.But then the pilot could fly here and then use the helicopter to take you here..cool I'll just--.Just an idea, okay..We have options..Yeah but--.Okay alright. As long as we have options..Yeah..And as long as we don't pick these three..You guys ready?.Yeah..Yes..One,.Temple of the Sun..two,.okay..three..Okay..Whispering Garden..Temple of the Moon flooded. Do you want.Temple--.Marsh?.Yeah that'll be fine..Okay..That actually helps..Um so these two are gone..Mhm..Whispering Garden.Okay.cool..Okay..That worked out as well as it could..Yeah..Let's uh try shoring up some things if we can..All we have to do is get back to Fool's Landing now..Yeah..Okay, alright um my turn..Mhm..Yeah..Okay.so.what do you guys recommend..One, two, three..Yeah..Okay..Alright..See what's up..Chalice.and this..One,.two,.three..So Coral Palace is flooded.again..Cliffs of Abandon.Rapidly sinking this island..Oh my gosh.

Okay..Bronze Gate is gone..No worries, we're fine..I think we can win next turn though..So.I'm the blue guy..Yeah..Yeah..If I go to you.Yeah..and then,.wait that wouldn't work..Yeah because I have a helicopter also..Oh you have a helicopter okay so I'll go to you.Yeah..use my helicopter to fly us both there and then you can use your helicopter to get us out..Yeah..And then, do I have one more.turn?.I have two more turns..Yeah, you do..I guess I'll just shore this up.Yeah..for the sake of shoring that up..Yeah..And I'll just play that to play that..Okay..We're in business. Alright..Okay..Sweet..And then three flood cards..Thank you..Okay, Tidal Palace.gone..Misty Marsh.gone..And Crimson Forest..Three for three..Okay..Alright.so it's my turn now?.Yeah..Mhm..So I guess I just play this?.Wahoo..And we got it..Yo.awesome..Great work team..We made better time that--.That was my goal..Yeah.good stuff..Nice.",u,sd  fc  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  aa  ba  ba  sd  sd  ba  b  ba  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  %  b  %  sv  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  %  sd  %  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  qy  fc  b  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  bk  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  b  b  %  sv  b  %  sv  qy  %  ng  sv  b  %  sd  sd  sd  aa  b  %  sv  b  aa  sd  sv  sd  sd  b  b  b  b  ba  sd  sd  fc  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  %  aa  b  b  sd  ny  b  b  %  sd  %  qw  sd  b  %  sd  sd  ad  b  ba  sd  %  sd  sd  ba  b  %  sd  ba  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  %  b  qy  qy  b  qy  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  b  fc  %  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  b  sd  ad  sd  b  sd  b  ba  %  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  b  sd  sd  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  sv  b  ba  sd  b  sd  b  aa  b  b  b  qy  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  b  b  sd  b  b  ba  b  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  ba  sd  sd  qy  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  %  h  sv  sd  b  %  sd  sd  b  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  fc  sd  %  sd  b  sd  ba  sv  aa  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  qw  sd  b  bk  b  b  sd  ba  b  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  qw  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  qw  %  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  aa  sv  sd  aa  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  qh  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  ad  sd  %  %  sd  ny  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  %  ba  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sv  ad  b  aa  %  sd  ba  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  ba  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  b  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  ^2  qy  sd  %  aa  aa  sd  b  b  b  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  nn  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ad  nn  sd  sd  b  bk  sd  sd  ba  sv  %  sd  sv  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  ad  ba  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  %  qy  nn  sv  sd  b  b  sd  qy  aa  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  b  sd  b  qy  b  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  b  b  ba  b  sd  qy  sd  sd  b  sd  qy  sd  bk  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  b  nn  sd  sd  b  b  b  ba  ba  sd  b  %  sv  sd  sd  sv  ba  sd  ny  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  fc  b  aa  b  ba  b  sd  b  ny  %  sd  sd  sd  ba  ba  ba  sd  sd  sd  ny  sd  b  b  sd  ad  ba  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  b^m  fc  qy  sd  sd  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  %  sd  b  sd  qy  b  ny  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  ba  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  b  %  qw  sd  b  b  b  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  %  sd  b  b  sd  b  %  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  ba  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  b  sd  ba  sd  %  ba  sv  sd  sd  b  ba  ba,"Alright, let's go Engineer.Let's do this.

Okay.Damn.Alright.Alright, um.So.I guess you'll probably spend your next turn like shoring stuff up.Yeah.Um.You could shore that one up.Do we need this though?.Unless.I mean no not really.The, the cards on the outside I feel like we don't really need.Okay.Um.you have two fires.two chalices and you have two.Earths.Two, yeah.Okay.So.I don't, you don't have to do anything.Okay.That's fine.Is there, I mean I might as well shore something up.Yeah I mean if you want to shore up Breaker's Bridge.You can--.I could fly here and shore those two up.Yeah.Yeah.Okay.Okay.Cool.Okay. One helicopter and more fire.(--) two of these.Thank you.Phantom Rock.Gone.done.The Lost Lagoon.also done.Well.That's (--).No, that's fine.Okay.Alright cool.My turn.Yes.Mhm.Okay.Um.well I could start moving towards the fire thing.and then like.you could start--.Then you'll be at fire and chalice.Yeah.Because.I if I take, if I get another fire card.And I give you this one.then you give me that one.

Well the Water's Rise.Yeah.So you can do that now.Oh, god.I think our board looks okay for the most part.Yeah agreed,.mostly non flooded.Okay.So uh.two.three.Well we lost the Howling Garden.Okay.Oh no.Oh god, okay. The Cliffs of Abandon.Where is that.Right here.Oh.Oh okay.Okay.Alright.And Breaker's Bridge. So Breaker's Birdge is gone.Oh man.Okay, alright.And then this gets discarded.Okay.Okay, um.so I will fly over to you.Okay.and give you my Earth card.Okay.So--.Or if you'd prefer, I could fly you down to the Temple of the Sun.What you could do.is you coud, where are you?.I'm here.You're here.You could move here for one.I'm here.and then fly both of us with oh you're here so you can move here for one.and then use your helicopter card to fly both of us here.Okay.So then you can, for the third.whatever action, you can give him your card.Okay.And then I can give him my card because I'll be on the same tile as him.And then what will you do with your two extra turns?.Uhh.You could move here and shore both of those up.Yeah I could do that and then by that time he'll, he'll be here so he'll be able to get this.Okay.Or that thing, whatever.Another option would be to take the helicopter lift.fly him over here and then we're all like in the same little area.to be able to give each other anything.Yeah I mean that wouldn't be a bad idea since we do have like.all three.like treasures right here.Um.But we already have this one.True.Yeah so we just need to focus on like.these two I guess.Yeah that's true, yeah.And.since we don't have much of a.Okay.Well we have the same number of lions as we do chalices.Oh yeah yeah yeah. Yeah.So we'll just see how the cards play.Where is the other lion card? Okay the other lions there so that's kinda halfway.Yeah.Okay.So what do we want to do.I'm open to either one.Um how many turns would it take if we did that? Because.you--.If I flew him there?.Yeah.So that's free.and then I would spend one giving this to him.Oh then you'd have to.spend more turns.Yeah.getting over to him.Yeah.Okay so let's just go with yours then.Okay so you would.you're.the.this one.Yes.Yeah.So you would go.Fly here.no wait no you would go here.and then you would fly both of us to here.Okay.And then.you would give him.that.Cool.So that was two.And then I have to get rid of one. I'm going to get rid of this one.Yeah.That was two moves cause one.and then that didn't count and then I gave it to him so I have one more move.Okay.You could.well if you already have one of the lion ones, you could start moving here.Okay.True.And then.Another helicopter and oh another lion.Nice.That worked out perfectly.Yeah.Okay the Copper Gate.gone.Oh man.Uh oh.Crimson Forest.and the Whispering Garden's.Oh god.Oh we can't lose this one.It's gonna be okay.Well we have this, we have two sandbags so we could.Yeah.Yeah.Okay.Mhm.so it's my turn.Mhm.Mhm.So I'm going to give this to you.Alright, cool.So you have to.get rid of something.Should I get rid of the.sandbag?.Um--.Probably.this.sandbag maybe. Cause if you're collecting the lion.Mhm.Mhm.Okay,.that was one move.Um.oh I can do, which.color am I?.Red.I can do.one, oh no, wait.One.two.and shore that up.Mine?.Wouldn't that already be three moves?.No.Oh right.You could move to the Misty Marsh and shore up Cliffs of Abandon.No because if I move here.and then I can shore this up.But you already gave him something.Yeah so that'll be three because I don't, I don't have to be standing on this to shore it up.Oh oh I thought you were going to shore up both. Yeah, go ahead.No.Yeah I mean unless you guys have other suggestions.No that works.Okay.Okay, alright.So two.Alright so a chalice. Oh.Oh nice. Oh.Oh. That changes things, okay.That would--.Game changer.That worked out very well.So.three.Okay.Cave of.Forget about that.Not today.Embers.Wait.Temple--.Wait you flip that back over?.Oh wait.That's gone.Oh yeah it's gone then. Okay.Temple of the Moon,.flip this over,.Oh god. Okay.We already used that though.and Silver Gate.Okie doke.Okay.Sinking fast.Okay cool alright so I'm going to cash in.on this.Woo.(get that old thing).Alright so that's one move um and then.I'm going to.give you.Well you guys have to be, are you on the same, yeah.No.No this is like, my power is like I'm a messenger so I'll give you that.He's the messenger.Oh, right.Okay.And then I have to throw something away.Would one helicopter lift like be okay?.Yeah probably.Because I feel like I would keep the sandbag just because like.Mhm if the Whisp--.If we want to keep Whispering Garden's really.Well either the Whispering Garden's or the Coral Palace.Yeah, whatever works.Mhm.Okay.Okay.Alright.So.then I have to draw two cards right?.Okay so another chalice.Okay alright another one of these and then.three of these.So Dunes of Deception,.Coral Palace.okay.and the Bronze Gate.Okay.The Bronze--.Bronze Gate.Okay.So we got to save the Coral Palace.Yeah what I think I'll do is.move here and dry both of those.Yeah, that's good.Okay.Okay.Nice.Okay.And then oh I could dry one more thing.No but you already did.(--) doesn't count as an action.three.Oh, right right.Is there anything else we want dry?.Can you go like anywhere on the uh board?.I already used my actions.Oh okay alright.Well I suppose I could take one of these back.use the sandbag on it.and then have one more action.Oh yeah true.But there's no where I really need to be.Yeah.Nah.and I don't need to give anyone anything.You could just save it in case we need it.Oh.Okay.Okay.cool.Sweet.Alright more chalices and more fire. I'll just throw out the fire.Okay.And.Oh but you still have too many cards.I still have too many cards, okay. I will throw out.the last chalice.Yeah we don't need it.Sounds good.Okay and could you pull flood cards please.Yes.Here you go.Thank you.Okay, Temple of the Sun,.the Tidal Palace,.Tidal Palace.the Misty Marsh.Oh.Get back fast.Okay.Yeah exactly.Alright.sweet.Okay.so I'm this one.Mhm.Yes.So.one.two.and then three.Boom.nice.Sweet.So we have three treasures.Now we just have to make it back to Fool's Landing.And then I have to get two of those.Yes.Okay I really hope it's not a flood card.Oh.Oh.Water's Rise so.move this up.Oh my god.As long as we don't pull both the Temple of the Moon and the Misty Marsh.Yeah.Uh oh.But would we even need it because we just have to get back here.But he'd drown.But like I'll drown and that's game over.But you can swim, oh I see what you mean. Okay.Oh god.Shuffle.Shuffle this good.Well could he swim here?.But there's nothing connected to it.Yeah so I'd be trapped.You'd be stuck there.Yeah.Okay,.But then the pilot could fly here and then use the helicopter to take you here.cool I'll just--.Just an idea, okay.We have options.Yeah but--.Okay alright. As long as we have options.Yeah.And as long as we don't pick these three.You guys ready?.Yeah.Yes.One,.Temple of the Sun.two,.okay.three.Okay.Whispering Garden.Temple of the Moon flooded. Do you want.Temple--.Marsh?.Yeah that'll be fine.Okay.That actually helps.Um so these two are gone.Mhm.Whispering Garden.Okay.cool.Okay.That worked out as well as it could.Yeah.Let's uh try shoring up some things if we can.All we have to do is get back to Fool's Landing now.Yeah.Okay, alright um my turn.Mhm.Yeah.Okay.so.what do you guys recommend.One, two, three.Yeah.Okay.Alright.See what's up.Chalice.and this.One,.two,.three.So Coral Palace is flooded.again.Cliffs of Abandon.Rapidly sinking this island.Oh my gosh.

Okay.Bronze Gate is gone.No worries, we're fine.I think we can win next turn though.So.I'm the blue guy.Yeah.Yeah.If I go to you.Yeah.and then,.wait that wouldn't work.Yeah because I have a helicopter also.Oh you have a helicopter okay so I'll go to you.Yeah.use my helicopter to fly us both there and then you can use your helicopter to get us out.Yeah.And then, do I have one more.turn?.I have two more turns.Yeah, you do.I guess I'll just shore this up.Yeah.for the sake of shoring that up.Yeah.And I'll just play that to play that.Okay.We're in business. Alright.Okay.Sweet.And then three flood cards.Thank you.Okay, Tidal Palace.gone.Misty Marsh.gone.And Crimson Forest.Three for three.Okay.Alright.so it's my turn now?.Yeah.Mhm.So I guess I just play

Team4201.csv,"Alright..Okay so.What I'm thinking is I can shore up these two, move over here, and then shore up these two?.Perfect..Alright..Okay..I think in the last game we forgot to discard down to five a lot.which we should keep in--.Oh yeah that's true..Yeah..(to forget)..Alright that's three..(Does for you).Oh, right away..Oh that over there..Oh..Are we allowed to look when you shuffle?.Hmm..Um.um.Okay..I need two..Lost Lagoon and Golden Gate..Right away that is out..Golden Gate..Bye..Lost Lagoon..Okay..Good..Alright..Umm.what cards do you have?

Yeah that makes sense..Yeah that makes sense..get things..Um.Is Whispering Garden worth saving there because you're close to getting the--.I don't think so.

Rut ro..So.I'm gonna.get rid of this.so I still have five.and I have to play this which means--.Alright.three..If we just keep like this little stretch alive, these three.That's really all we need..That's what we need and the Fool's Landing..Alright..Sorry..One two three..Temple of the Sun's gone..They're both the same..Um Breaker's.Bridge.and.Cliff's of Abandon..Oh man..Alright alright..Okay. Oh..Oh wait, we're good. Okay..Yup..Okay, so.Alright so.I will, one two, I'll give this to you definitely um but I need to get to you first..Give the wind?.So I shore up Breaker's Bridge and then fly over and then give it to you. That'd be three..Sure..Okay..Okay..And do I need to sandbag anything? Move anyone anywhere?.No..Hmm.

Team4252.csv,"Okay so.Engineer?.(--).Yeah finish (--).Oh I start I just forgot the time I (thought).Looks like we can flip over a lot of these. We can shore them up..Looking how it's positioned..Is worth it though shall we just consider just playing with this set of top board cuz that all we need so we can just.She is not gonna reach there just (yeah) but she can still do it..Well we can get there like two moves pretty much.Cuz I can.Every character can move three spaces..No well we should..I don't even have to move I can just --.Cuz we waste so much time just trying keep stuff float that's like.Right..We don't really need to..Well we should..I think you should right..I mean if everything disappears..Uh huh..That's not..Yeah we are kind stuck..I am gonna turn this. I don't have to move I am gonna turn as one turn..Really good..Let's (cheer) I guess that's the flood one..We do want some (warn) cards (up it)..Then you can make a second..Yeah..Well you can't we can't flip this one I think you can flip we can flip too but I think that has to be adjacent..Yeah I (could).Yeah..She can do turn around..Oh they don't have to be adjacent?.I think they do have to be next to you..Yeah so so here.Right..So you you can.Like they have to be like right like you have to be like touching them so.Aw..She moves the Whispring Garden..So here this could be your first one..Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh..Oh okay..Yeah that's what I meant.You know what I mean and then.You are sure they have to be?.They (--) have to be (--).Yeah they have to be next to you..So then like just for example if you want here you can do these two if you would if you want to do that but.Oh..I can do ones at the diagonal..Oh oh oh okay..Okay..Yeah then that will be all of your moves all together..Got you..Got you okay..Well okay I just flip those two..Yes that was move one..eah that's one yep..That was one move..And then you can move.So and then this would be move two and then fliping them would be move three..You guy.Okay..And then you can flip yeah. I think that's the best (benefits) to keep islands alive..And then flipping what flipping more?.Yeah..These two yeah..Oh oh oh oh got you got you okay..Em cuz they are adjacent to you and you could two at a time..Oh so she can do a lot..So yeah she can (--) up to four if she is at the right place already..Okay okay..Yeah..Got you..Yeah..(Take me to this)..Alright..Glad you understand my role better than I do..Let somebody does..(One of) those..One of those stupid things..Alright..Eh.Oh..And then (flip) well we don't move the ah we get one of those oh no I don't know.Yeah..Yeah they rise..Okay we gotta shuffle the deck first..Oops..OOh okay..Yeah yeah yeah..So no one has any sandbags if we get helicopter lifts..But tighter.I think I'd save it for in case of emergency..Phantom Rock..Yeah..Phantom Rock cuz it's fine it's gone..Yeah (brought) here oh this is gone so Phantom Rock is gone..Oh my..Oh..(Say).Golden Gold Gate..Hmm..Gold Gate is gone..Wow..Yeah..Wow okay that's quick..(Ta).At least they are often in the corner..Get rid of that stupid things..Yeah..Here we go..And then oh we don't have any flood cards to discard..Alright so..Yeah..(You are up)..My turn..Mmm..Guess I don't really need to..Should maybe I should. should I?.Give a treasure card to anybody?.I guess it doesn't really matter yeah..You can..NnMm..Cuz.Great yeah..(I mean) there is.Is that enough for the (Board Gate) Hmm..Yeah..I can move somewhere..I don't know how helpful that one move..Well we should try cuz the exception policy you can move (anywhere) we should try to save Copper Gate..So we can trade cards easily..Maybe I'll just like come over to Cliffs of Abandon. how that --.I would move.Yeah..Yeah..Yeah because --.That takes two moves yeah..One two..Yeah..Alright..And then you can send cards to anyone. Should we just utilize that now cuz we don't really (use) that last time (when) we could.So we can centralize..So you could either give the chalice to her or give the yeah.Yeah give me the chalice yeah..Yeah..Well actually wait we know what I you know what I just thought though like --.And then depending.Mm..If we are going for these..Like..Each player should be giving for like one.Yeah..Thing so maybe it would be a better bet for you to get for you to have this and I'll hang on to the --.Right..Yeah..Oh..That would work I think that's fine too..Cuz then I am gonna have too many..You know what I mean?.Yeah and then we have to get rid of something, which would be beneficial..Yeah..Okay..And I probably end up giving you this in a turn cuz this --.Alright..Okay..Right you should (--) for a treasure..So I can pick up.Yeah..Yeah that's okay..Yeah..Okay..So you can shoot for that as for now..We do do that last time too..Yeah..Yeah..And it helped out..Alright so I got my.I got sandbags and here is this Moon Rock here..That's good..Okay..So then it just two then to flood cards..Yeah so one two..I wonder we will see.We got.Nothing is flooded right now it's just nice..Breaker's Bridge and Whispering Garden..Okay..Breaker's Bridge..Alright and there is the Garden okay..And Whispering Garden right above it..Are we good?.Okay pilot?.Okay my turn..Yeah..Em..I can..Go here and turn this over..Okay..What you could you could fly on Breaker's Bridge to that one and that one over if you want to that's gonna be one move..I could that yeah.So I can.And flying is not a move right it is. it is one okay..Or one move to fly there.Flying is one move for him.Flying is one move so I (could).But you can anywhere..Unless we use helicopter lift yeah you can that works.You can fly there..I can do this.And turn that..Then turn.Perfect..And then that's three..And then the Engineer might be able to give you a card if it helps.Okay..Okay..And.That's three..Eh three that's right never mind..Yeah that's it.So then you can grab tubes..Yeah..Oh..And a fire.Okay..Perfect..And then.So she really useful.To flip cards..Okay Cliffs of Abandon?.Right there..Yeah..(--).You are one.And then Lost Lagoon which is the.Right there.Okay..So we've got two helicopter lifts on the board sandbags okay then it's my turn.I could give you this.Just because if you all but then NnMm.(--).I don't know could be worse.Well you could and then my turn I can give her the fire.Right..Yeah..Let's see if can I get to you.(--) yeah.And then the Messenger you've already get one of those.What color is pilot? Pilot is blue..So I am gonna say collecting these is that a little more important thing.The yeah.One..Two..Actually move around on here cuz we don't really need to..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Isn't the gold collect these real quick?.Wait..Yeah pretty much..Yeah we wanna get them so we could get the treasure..That's yeah..Right..So you should give him one..Yeah so it's yeah you take.I'll take.This guy and you can.Probably this guy on the right if you have to hopefully the.No he is five..I have five.Yeah so I can wait.Yeah..Okay..You can wait yeah..Okay..Done..Alright so here we go..Aw..Yes..Yes so wait your turn make sure the first thing you do is get rid of them yeah.Yeah..Okay so that's good and then two more flood cards.Okay..We got Temple the Moon.Put the top..And Iron Gate so we are here..Alright..Alright..So --.Where do I wanna go..Well..I mean if you.You can.If you want, you could give me..Yeah the chalice there if we wanna --.I mean that just that's an option..Once one turn.Uh huh..We have to be on the same thing. We are not on the same thing..Oh..Yeah..So you can.So you move here you are red right?.Uh huh..(See) move here.And then give to her..So you gave to her.You can flip and then that would be three..Oh..Yeah..(--) fails you guys are both.Okay..Game (--).Yeah so I mean and it's like tough to get around with other center piece there.kay..Two..Alright..So use two of these..Why don't we always keep one of those..Oh..Jesus..So yeah that's a pretty common card..No seems like I only get it..There you go..Okay well it's yeah put them on top here let's wait before we pull three should we yeah should be fine there is nothing that's valuable we can lose this.Oops..Oh you gotta put oh sorry I'll just shuffle them..Oops..(--) you give.Temple of the Moon..Oh..Yeah that's why that's why (--) I was gonna.Which (--).Lost Lagoon..Right there.I can lose that one it's fine let's get down Temple of the Sun.Breaker's Bridge..In --.NnMm.Since we just lost Temple of the Moon, we don't want to lose Temple of the Sun so we can get these..Yeah..Yes that becomes the priority..Okay..Which means your card is really important..Okay..Okay we'll save that for now..So we'll save sandbags with that in mind..Oh..Get rid of that..Alright..See I have (a bit) of these.So my turn..Em..Alright..Well first thing I am gonna give you..Let's think about trading yeah..These..So we've almost got three..And then.Anything else (there)?.Em..(--) then Messenger yeah that's one turn.(Really see) anything else I need to do?.At this point..Oh wait where am I?.I am.Yeah right here..Oh see I can't do anyway. I don't have enough turn..It doesn't matter you are the Messenger you can yeah you can give to me.Yeah..Alright..So then I will pick up two cards..Well it's.I got another sandbags and another.Moon Rock..Forget what's called..Perfect token..No technically we all have enough to get a treasure we just have to start trading cards.Yeah we just gotta trade it..Mm huh..So I yeah.Uh huh..Alright these so now I gotta pick up three we are on three of these now..Yeah..Alright we have Whispering Garden, Iron Gate..Cliffs of Abandon..Okay it's gone..Iron Gate is gone if you wanna give me that card.Cliffs of Abandon?.Where is the.Eh oh..Eh oh.That's flipped yeah it's fine that's fine yeah.Yeah flip it..Yeah Whispering Garden..Mm..Eh Howling Whispering wow okay.Yeah we will be fine..Oh dear..Alrighty..Okay we gotta think about how we are gonna use them cuz there are two.

Do you flip Whispering Garden cuz if we lost that, that's a big deal. Everything else we can kind of lost. If you guys get lost,at least you can swim to stuff around it..But if Whispering Garden gets well.Should we --.Well I mean what you guyes feel?.I was kind of thinking Cliffs of Abandon but --.Cuz we are all on it but he's right we just swim..There is no yeah there is no cost for let's see if there is anything she wanna trade cuz I am gonna give you this card.Okay..If we have to --.Well he doesn't need to trade anything else so why don't you just flip Whispering?.Yeah..If we have to swim what's the big deal..You just go to as long as the card you can go okay so it's not gonna affect us okay..Nothing..(No).Yeah..Just go to --. As long as he is at adjacent yeah..Yeah..Let's just.That's not a penalty you know..So let's just (assume).So I could do Whispering Garden..Yeah..Yeah..(Okay).And then somebody else can try to do Cliffs..Yeah I can do that I can put both of these..Okay I should I am gonna --.Wait hang on he has to finish his turn..Yeah that's yeah.(--) the game..Cards and I have.Six but I can get rid of --.Wait..NnMm..No..Don't(--) the chalice. You don't wanna give that one well she can give it to yeah you can get rid of that one why don't we just.NnMm..Well she's.Yeah..Get rid of it because I can give him a turn..That's what I was thinking we should use.Yeah..Okay..Because she used (--) yeah that's fine.And then flip me..Lift..Eh flip me..Yeah let's see..Okay..Copper Gate..Which is right here..Crimson Forest..Right above..And then Howling Garden which is right here..Okay..Okay..So okay..Alright..So we just want to keep an eye on the Howling Garden just in case..Yeah..Yeah..Okay should I flip Cliffs of Abandon then?.Alrighty your turn..Why don't you are green em..Yeah so I can.Why you give me one..Why don't --.Yeah..I am gonna move yeah I'll move to.So then.Here..So move and then flip.Wait no no no you gotta give him.I can give you one cuz this is you don't --.Why don't you give her these?.The flame yeah so I can that pretty sone..The flame..Uh huh..Engineer the flame..And then..And then one more move we can flip I can either flip that if --.Em..Why don't you flip the Cliffs of Abandon?.Em..The smae case..Yeah..Yeah..Alright looking good so now you need to (two card)?.That's not (card we) even need..Yeah it's not that why yeah.Well what's the big deal to save it..So we don't drown..No wasn't..(Justin).Flood..It doesn't matter. I get water rises so I have to -- Let's get to the sky anyways.Yeah see I forget we get if we do that could be something we lose..Ta.Flood..Okay I need three..Those..It's gone to legendary --.Okay..Flood level at this point..Uh huh..So we need three cards?.Yeah we probably gonna lost. Oh we messed up..Who we draw put this down cuz we need to save Howling Garden..Why?.But (--) Whipering Garden. (Mind). We are good we are good. I was worried yeah I was worried (--) lost some. We are saving them. We are fine. We don't need to. I can llok into this one probably..Right..We saw Whispering are we okay?.Right..Okay ha..Uh huh..I do have two sandbags if you want to..Em..NnMm..Cuz this is yeah this is Whispering Garden but (--) only..Okay..Flood it and then there is Crimson Forest, which is gone. And then city of -- Cliffs of Abandon..Question is gone..That's just (we around).(So I'll) flip that..Okay that was the closest one right (there)..Yeah so see we would have this one..Yeah..Yeah so..Good thing..Alright..Okay and then..Em so now it's.Engineer's turn..So didn't she just go? I just want -- yeah.No Engineer..Me yeah..Now it's my turn..So I have to be on --.Alright so where (--).You (would).The thing to get it so there are --.So (on).So it's two..Two..And then there is your.Then one get to the.Your fire..Yes..I like the fire..Okay so yeah one treasure done..Alright so.Use your two cards?.Yeah helicopter..Yes..More of these we've got plenty of these we've got enough for every --.Good you didn't get flood..We have a lot..Yeah so I can give him one.(Thing)..Em..Alright..No..(No) three..Right..Alright Howling Garden..Breaker's Bridge is gone. Yeah (--) Breaker's Bridge as well..Howling Garden is out of here..That's not good..Yeah..It's gone..Copper Gate..That's a period..Which?.It's gone..And the last is Breaker's Bridge, which I have (it here).(Well) it's gone..Man I am just destroy the whole island..That's a --.Oh oh..Okay..Alright.So.Where am I?.You are up..Alright I think I am going to.Goint to flip these two..Uh huh..Flip..One..That's the only one you need to flip..I am gonna do this to them just in case cuz I don't cuz there is nothing else I can really.Yo you should give me that card yeah..Except so yeah that's my.Basically you waste a turn..Flipping that the way it needs to..Do you know what I mean? Like it was something better that we could have done. Can you give two cards? Is that a --.Oh..Well..Yeah..We might.Yeah but there is.Yeah..We could yeah..Are you allowed to do that? Why are we not doing two cards its turns..That counts as two turns but yeah..Because I don't need to give two cards like.Could we do that?.Yeah..I mean someone eles can but I don't need to..I've got this out here..Okay okay..So like I use my three turns effectively but for someone else might be more effective to give away to.Yeah I am gonna need to --.Yeah..Right to give two cards instead of a move. Okay got you..Yeah some of this (guy) this could..Yeah..See cuz I've already have two of these anyway you know.Yeah..Got you got you..So em.Okay..I can pick up two of these now..There we go so..Now we are done. This is good okay..I gotta get rid of something though, so I guess I'll just have to get rid of --.So yeah..Well we can..There is nothing guess just discard it..I guess you can even use it but.Yes there is nothing you are on the field..(Drag).Kay..Oh yeah there is nothing.Okay and then flood warning..Until we get.Oh yeah..So we have enough to get two..We got the Dunes. We got the Cave of Embers and Silver Gate..Yeah we are done..Oh..(And so on).Can you grab Silver Gate?.Silver Gate..Please..Yeah okay..Thank you..Yeah..Kay..Alright..Yeah..Go ahead there..I am up okay..Technically I don't need.Anything..You should probably just get on Fool's Landing..Okay I'll go on Fool's Landing..(It's) turn away..Wait..Just thought of something..Uh huh..What's up?.Yeah what you want to do?.What if you give the two cards to her?.Cuz I'll get them quicker..Because.Yeah cuz she's coming up..Oh that's right yeah..So yeah it's two turns that works..So it's two turns down..Kay..And then move to Fool's Landing..So one two.Yep..Well we gotta need our four treasures move to the Fool's landing that what you said as a flight..Oh we are..Move to (Fool os).Yeah..Move to Fool's landing..We can win after three..Yeah..Yeah so from my -- Oh and then you get two cards. We wanna sack yeah..Move to Fool's landing..Oh you gotta do your thing ta..I just get grab Coral Palace, too..Yep..There you go..Thank you..Then I'll be on Fool's Landing..(Tighter and stuff).And here is your thing. When it gets your turn, Engineer?.So just need three of those gets --.To get over there I might I am going to use helicopter..We can.Before your turn..Well you have helicopter anyways..Yeah..Yeah we have three helicopters so we are pretty good shape right now..You wanna helicopter here?.Are we play (it wrong)?.Bless you..Thank you..Do we miss someting?.No..Oh..Oh that's right..(Drag).Which tile tile over there?.Because we weren't together..My bad..And he gave me two cards..We weren't together..So you gave me two cards..Oh..Oh crap..And then even know he wasn't they were on the same tile. weren't they?.No..Oh you are right..Cuz then he moved..I can.One helicopter move.And then (he).Over and then gave you two cards that's the end of my.Okay..Oh okay that's end of turn okay..Okay..my three turns..Okay..So instead of Fool's Landing you are just going to the same place..That's what it was..Yeah..Okay..Yeah..I keep forgeting that..Alright so we are okay now..Tidal.Bronze Gate.And then oh.Coral Palace..That's one yeah..I can fix that..We need that..Yeah..Yeah well we wanna the second one I get the treasure well that's not the one I have to go all the way.Yeah..Okay..It's fine it's fine though cuz you are getting.Yeah..Okay..Okay so.Let's see. I am up now..You have to be on..I have to go all the way to that one. Don't I?.There..Why don't we use one of the helicoprters.Oops sorry..Yeah (--) use..Yeah..So I mean I could use my helicopter right now..Yeah for me to get me to the --.Get you here..Uh huh..(Ta).Yeah that's -- My first turn is collecting the treasure..So get rid of that card..I pick a treasure that's two turns..Which is that one. Well helicopter does not count as one yeah..Right or no he doesn't count as a turn okay as a move..No..And (--) that. That's one turn..Then..Two turns then. Should I flip this or do you want should I move here..Should probably. Well you can use sandbags if you want. I can just move on Fool's Landing and we are (good) to go..Just move to the Fool's Landing I think..Okay..(--).Go diagonal right. You can move diagonal so you can --.Yep I can ove diagonal..Alright..That's right you got a treasure..So.Yeah..Go ahead there..Okay..So then ah I put two cards. Before we do the flood warning, we should probably do sandbags on Coral Palace cuz we are gonna need that..I didn't get flood warning and (flame)..Okay..Though should I (--).I mean we don't have to use it. She can probably cuz I have to pull three cards..Okay..Oh..But it's impossible to get Coral Palace because we've already put that one so --.Watch Tower..It's Watch Tower, Misty Marsh..Yeah..And --.Misty Marsh..And Temple of the Sun..Temple --.Got it..Yeah it's on there. Okay, let's go back over there and it's your turn..Alright..So you have you can get that one..Ah I need to be where..I can use a helicopter move you over Whispering Garden..Yeah that's gonna a bus but --.That way you just use your one turn..Alright..So then we need that last (turn).I gonna save this to get out of here..Yeah..Yeah..Oh I am going here..So your first move would be collecting eh --.Get rid of the helicopters I will put it here..Oh..Okay..(--).This is my first move..I've gotta three of these. Now everyone needs to get to the right place..And then.Wait..Em..Where did you hold on a second where did you come from?.Pretty much..For your next two moves.Mm..She came from here..She came from there..(--).I just cuz I just.Alright..I don't know if you guys would wanna like back track but I was just thinking.She just wanna go here..Fool's Landing. I mean I have these and it only takes one step I don't need helicopter..Yeah let's set that, too..But it doesn't matter. We can do whatever..Cuz now we have to go all the way back around for her to get.You guys wanna -- we can do a four treasures..Back here..Oh it's true..Well then she still gotta we gotta three moves so she can move here. You have to flip that yeah..Yeah only used one..Right I used one move..To get the treauser so you can --.Yeah but I still can't I need to get there..But but we (--).Yeah..You know what I mean? We have to go all the way back on the board though. So if instead we do not use the helicopter on her and she just wants here. I have the four thing and I could just do that instead..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah we can (at least) do that..Okay so I am back (talking) give me this..Should we just do that thing?.Can we do that?.Sorry for back tracking but I just thought of it..That's fine. Never mind..Alright..Yeah..Okay..So instead.I'll take the helicopter off..Okay..You started here..Uh huh..And --.What's then what we were doing then?.How about if I just turn tiles. Cuz I can wait we are gonna need them. I can turn two tiles with my power, my super powers..She can go anywhere doesn't matter yeah..Yeah..Yeah..I think it's important..Yeah that's a Coral Palance..One..And then you should do two moves to get on Fool's Landing okay..And then I can do one two..Alright..Kay..Oh that does --.So now..No it's hopefully nothing well..And then three flood cards. Oh flood rises though..Oh I need another helicopter see ta..Ah..Nice..Ah shit..That's fine though we should be we should be okay..Oh but it is still risky..Can I say that in this experiment?.Oh my god..Okay no swearing aloud. Does that was in the rule?.Then I gave some interesting though..To trade that?.Wait you have to shuffle.Now some.Oh..Oh (goodness).Yeah we do cuz this is flood warning..Wait..Here you go you can shuffle..Sorry..So yeah shuffle this..(Bad) that might our last.And then nothing really needs to get sandbags just be allowed us to flood..Our last one..Three yeah..Alright..Tidal Palace..Oh right here. So the Tidal Palace is gone..That's gone..Cliffs of Abandon..That's flooded..So keep that one over there..Whispering Garden..(Get) worse..Here it is..That one right there..Okay..Okay cool..Okay..Go..So my turn..Alright so.Yeah..Yeah I need to (shut up) the game..Oh wait I gotta put the (--) back..Oh..You can only have five cards in your hand..Oh this right here..Oh..So yeah just get around the chalice or something..Alright..Em I don't have a child..Just get rid of one of the.Over that that is..To get rid of this cuz I am not gonna need it..TWe are now the chalice the statue..(Forget).The lion..Just get rid of one of the (dudes) cuz I got.Yeah..Yeah..Do we have..Yeah..Yeah we are good I have these too..We don't need that one..Yeah..Okay..Alright now it's my turn..So.I am going to make my first..Move there..Get the treasure..Then I am going to.So we got the treasure..And then you don't mind (if I ask me).And now..I guess should I go to.Uh huh..Fool's Landing that's my last move..Yeah..OYep last move and then do a helicopter lift..Oh..WOh let's see..NnMm..She has to finish a turn..No because..Yeah that's true..Right?.Yeah..Either way..Yeah..Right these (are not gonna) really need them anyway..I can just move there..And --.Where are we, we are still on three.Or anytime. Can you just use that helicopter move and then fly us out there and then we are done..Wait..Yeah and anytime same with you same with you yeah..Play (it) anytime..So we don't have to finish is. She doesn't have to finish her turn..Yeah..No..We don't really know (--).I --.I'll move over and you use this to get out..No no no I am saying we are done..Yeah..Right?.Yeah exactly..Oh..Check me..Right..Yeah we are close to everything..She's done..So then..If we use yeah..One so right now one helicopter here..Yeah..We can do we can still do that?.Yeah and then and then another one to get out of here..And then wanna get out.Yeah exactly so if you wanna play that.Yeah..So I don't even.You know what I mean? Yeah, we don't really have to get that (--).Well you have to finish your turn..(I don't).You can doesn't really.It's a move point..Flood..Wait we have played if playing against the clock is it a clock game?.Alright we'll just finish it..Yeah..Just cuz.Oh..Tend to be faster (--) than the other thing.It's boom helicopter go..Okay..Then (the) time shorter..Yeah exactly..Wait yeah if you move either way. Yes so I'll play the helicopter lift card to (--) over doing there..Okay..Helicopter lift done..And then to be there the helicopter lift for the four of us..Flood so..Yes cuz we are there..Yeah..Okay..Turn your Dune and you Coral yeah..Do yeah just do that..Then this one..And then you play --.The second helicopter lift that and end the game..Oh..Oh we are gone..Yeah..We are safe..Three treasures..Kay..Wow..That was quicker, wasn't it?.Was that faster?.Good by..(Alright) oh no..What was our first time?.Okay..(Might be en)",u,sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sv  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  aa  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  sv  sv  b  %  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  ba  bk  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  bk  b  sv  sd  qy  sd  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  %  b  sv  sd  b  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  b  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  bk  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  b  %  sd  b  sd  ba  b  ba  %  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  ba  sd  qy  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  ba  sd  qy  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  b  b  sd  qy  qh  sd  b  sd  %  %  sd  %  sv  b  sd  b  b  b  sv  sd  sv  sv  b  b  sd  b  b  sv  sd  b  aa  b  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  ba  b  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  b  %  sd  ad  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ad  ba  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  aa  sd  b  b  sd  b  ba  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  %  sv  sd  b  b  ad  b  sd  qw  qy  %  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  qy  %  aa  sd  aa  b  sv  sv  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  b  ad  b  sd  sd  b  ny  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  ba  sd  ba  sd  ba  %  sd  b  sd  %  sd  aa  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sv  b  sv  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  %  b  sd  qy  sd  sd  %  qy  %  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  b  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  %  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  b  b  sd  ad  sd  %  sd  sd  ba  b  sd  ad  b  sd  ad  b  sv  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  ad  b  sd  sd  sd  nn  b  sd  b  sd  sv  sv  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  nn  qh  sd  %  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  oo_co_cc  ^h  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  b  b  sd  ad  qo  aa  sd  %  b  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  %  qh  %  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  qh  sd  aa  b^m  sd  sd  sv  %  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  qw  sd  b  sd  b  b  b  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  ba  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qw  aa  sd  %  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  ny  sd  sd  b  sd  b  ny  sv  sd  sd  sd  %  b  b  nn  sd  b  fc  sd  sd  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  b  b  b  %  qw  sd  sd  sd  b  b^m  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  b  %  b  sd  aa  b  aa  sd  sd  sd  qy  b  sd  sd  b  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  %  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sv  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  %  qy  sd  sd  b  fc  b  b  b  b  ad  sd  sd  sd  ad  sd  sd  %  sv  b  qw  qw  sd  sd  %  sd  aa  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  sv  b  sd  qy  qy  fc  fc  qy  nn  b  aa  sd  qw  sd  fa  sd  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  nn  aa  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  fc  b  sd  b  sv  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  sv  b  sd  b  b  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  qh  fa  %  b  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  nn  sd  %  sd  sd  sv  b  %  sd  sd  b  sv  %  b  ad  b  sd  sd  b  qy  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  qy^d  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sv  sd  b  b  sd  qy  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  %  %  %  qw  aa  sd  %  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  sd  fc  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  b  sd  b  b  sd  fc  qy  qy  sd  fc  b  b  b  %  sd  b  qy^d  b  %  qw  sd  sd  b  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  ba  %  sv  sd  sd  b  ba  ba  sv  sv  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  ba  sd  %  sd  fa  ad  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ad  sd  sv  sd  sd  b  b  b  %  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  ad  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  qy  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  %  sd  bf  ad  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  ^h  sd  sd  nn  aa  b  b  aa  b  sv  sd  %  sd  sd  %  fc  sd  sd  b  nn  h  %  sd  sd  b  b  aa  b  sd  b  sd  sd  %  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  sd  sv  sv  sd  sv  sd  sd  qy  ad  b  %  b  sd  sd  b  sd  aa  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  aa  b  b  sd  ad  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b^m  b  ba  sd  sd  qw  b  sd  b  qy,"Okay so.Engineer?.(--).Yeah finish (--).Oh I start I just forgot the time I (thought).Looks like we can flip over a lot of these. We can shore them up.Looking how it's positioned.Is worth it though shall we just consider just playing with this set of top board cuz that all we need so we can just.She is not gonna reach there just (yeah) but she can still do it.Well we can get there like two moves pretty much.Cuz I can.Every character can move three spaces.No well we should.I don't even have to move I can just --.Cuz we waste so much time just trying keep stuff float that's like.Right.We don't really need to.Well we should.I think you should right.I mean if everything disappears.Uh huh.That's not.Yeah we are kind stuck.I am gonna turn this. I don't have to move I am gonna turn as one turn.Really good.Let's (cheer) I guess that's the flood one.We do want some (warn) cards (up it).Then you can make a second.Yeah.Well you can't we can't flip this one I think you can flip we can flip too but I think that has to be adjacent.Yeah I (could).Yeah.She can do turn around.Oh they don't have to be adjacent?.I think they do have to be next to you.Yeah so so here.Right.So you you can.Like they have to be like right like you have to be like touching them so.Aw.She moves the Whispring Garden.So here this could be your first one.Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.Oh okay.Yeah that's what I meant.You know what I mean and then.You are sure they have to be?.They (--) have to be (--).Yeah they have to be next to you.So then like just for example if you want here you can do these two if you would if you want to do that but.Oh.I can do ones at the diagonal.Oh oh oh okay.Okay.Yeah then that will be all of your moves all together.Got you.Got you okay.Well okay I just flip those two.Yes that was move one.eah that's one yep.That was one move.And then you can move.So and then this would be move two and then fliping them would be move three.You guy.Okay.And then you can flip yeah. I think that's the best (benefits) to keep islands alive.And then flipping what flipping more?.Yeah.These two yeah.Oh oh oh oh got you got you okay.Em cuz they are adjacent to you and you could two at a time.Oh so she can do a lot.So yeah she can (--) up to four if she is at the right place already.Okay okay.Yeah.Got you.Yeah.(Take me to this).Alright.Glad you understand my role better than I do.Let somebody does.(One of) those.One of those stupid things.Alright.Eh.Oh.And then (flip) well we don't move the ah we get one of those oh no I don't know.Yeah.Yeah they rise.Okay we gotta shuffle the deck first.Oops.OOh okay.Yeah yeah yeah.So no one has any sandbags if we get helicopter lifts.But tighter.I think I'd save it for in case of emergency.Phantom Rock.Yeah.Phantom Rock cuz it's fine it's gone.Yeah (brought) here oh this is gone so Phantom Rock is gone.Oh my.Oh.(Say).Golden Gold Gate.Hmm.Gold Gate is gone.Wow.Yeah.Wow okay that's quick.(Ta).At least they are often in the corner.Get rid of that stupid things.Yeah.Here we go.And then oh we don't have any flood cards to discard.Alright so.Yeah.(You are up).My turn.Mmm.Guess I don't really need to.Should maybe I should. should I?.Give a treasure card to anybody?.I guess it doesn't really matter yeah.You can.NnMm.Cuz.Great yeah.(I mean) there is.Is that enough for the (Board Gate) Hmm.Yeah.I can move somewhere.I don't know how helpful that one move.Well we should try cuz the exception policy you can move (anywhere) we should try to save Copper Gate.So we can trade cards easily.Maybe I'll just like come over to Cliffs of Abandon. how that --.I would move.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah because --.That takes two moves yeah.One two.Yeah.Alright.And then you can send cards to anyone. Should we just utilize that now cuz we don't really (use) that last time (when) we could.So we can centralize.So you could either give the chalice to her or give the yeah.Yeah give me the chalice yeah.Yeah.Well actually wait we know what I you know what I just thought though like --.And then depending.Mm.If we are going for these.Like.Each player should be giving for like one.Yeah.Thing so maybe it would be a better bet for you to get for you to have this and I'll hang on to the --.Right.Yeah.Oh.That would work I think that's fine too.Cuz then I am gonna have too many.You know what I mean?.Yeah and then we have to get rid of something, which would be beneficial.Yeah.Okay.And I probably end up giving you this in a turn cuz this --.Alright.Okay.Right you should (--) for a treasure.So I can pick up.Yeah.Yeah that's okay.Yeah.Okay.So you can shoot for that as for now.We do do that last time too.Yeah.Yeah.And it helped out.Alright so I got my.I got sandbags and here is this Moon Rock here.That's good.Okay.So then it just two then to flood cards.Yeah so one two.I wonder we will see.We got.Nothing is flooded right now it's just nice.Breaker's Bridge and Whispering Garden.Okay.Breaker's Bridge.Alright and there is the Garden okay.And Whispering Garden right above it.Are we good?.Okay pilot?.Okay my turn.Yeah.Em.I can.Go here and turn this over.Okay.What you could you could fly on Breaker's Bridge to that one and that one over if you want to that's gonna be one move.I could that yeah.So I can.And flying is not a move right it is. it is one okay.Or one move to fly there.Flying is one move for him.Flying is one move so I (could).But you can anywhere.Unless we use helicopter lift yeah you can that works.You can fly there.I can do this.And turn that.Then turn.Perfect.And then that's three.And then the Engineer might be able to give you a card if it helps.Okay.Okay.And.That's three.Eh three that's right never mind.Yeah that's it.So then you can grab tubes.Yeah.Oh.And a fire.Okay.Perfect.And then.So she really useful.To flip cards.Okay Cliffs of Abandon?.Right there.Yeah.(--).You are one.And then Lost Lagoon which is the.Right there.Okay.So we've got two helicopter lifts on the board sandbags okay then it's my turn.I could give you this.Just because if you all but then NnMm.(--).I don't know could be worse.Well you could and then my turn I can give her the fire.Right.Yeah.Let's see if can I get to you.(--) yeah.And then the Messenger you've already get one of those.What color is pilot? Pilot is blue.So I am gonna say collecting these is that a little more important thing.The yeah.One.Two.Actually move around on here cuz we don't really need to.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Isn't the gold collect these real quick?.Wait.Yeah pretty much.Yeah we wanna get them so we could get the treasure.That's yeah.Right.So you should give him one.Yeah so it's yeah you take.I'll take.This guy and you can.Probably this guy on the right if you have to hopefully the.No he is five.I have five.Yeah so I can wait.Yeah.Okay.You can wait yeah.Okay.Done.Alright so here we go.Aw.Yes.Yes so wait your turn make sure the first thing you do is get rid of them yeah.Yeah.Okay so that's good and then two more flood cards.Okay.We got Temple the Moon.Put the top.And Iron Gate so we are here.Alright.Alright.So --.Where do I wanna go.Well.I mean if you.You can.If you want, you could give me.Yeah the chalice there if we wanna --.I mean that just that's an option.Once one turn.Uh huh.We have to be on the same thing.

Do you flip Whispering Garden cuz if we lost that, that's a big deal. Everything else we can kind of lost. If you guys get lost,at least you can swim to stuff around it.But if Whispering Garden gets well.Should we --.Well I mean what you guyes feel?.I was kind of thinking Cliffs of Abandon but --.Cuz we are all on it but he's right we just swim.There is no yeah there is no cost for let's see if there is anything she wanna trade cuz I am gonna give you this card.Okay.If we have to --.Well he doesn't need to trade anything else so why don't you just flip Whispering?.Yeah.If we have to swim what's the big deal.You just go to as long as the card you can go okay so it's not gonna affect us okay.Nothing.(No).Yeah.Just go to --. As long as he is at adjacent yeah.Yeah.Let's just.That's not a penalty you know.So let's just (assume).So I could do Whispering Garden.Yeah.Yeah.(Okay).And then somebody else can try to do Cliffs.Yeah I can do that I can put both of these.Okay I should I am gonna --.Wait hang on he has to finish his turn.Yeah that's yeah.(--) the game.Cards and I have.Six but I can get rid of --.Wait.NnMm.No.Don't(--) the chalice.

Like it was something better that we could have done. Can you give two cards? Is that a --.Oh.Well.Yeah.We might.Yeah but there is.Yeah.We could yeah.Are you allowed to do that? Why are we not doing two cards its turns.That counts as two turns but yeah.Because I don't need to give two cards like.Could we do that?.Yeah.I mean someone eles can but I don't need to.I've got this out here.Okay okay.So like I use my three turns effectively but for someone else might be more effective to give away to.Yeah I am gonna need to --.Yeah.Right to give two cards instead of a move. Okay got you.Yeah some of this (guy) this could.Yeah.See cuz I've already have two of these anyway you know.Yeah.Got you got you.So em.Okay.I can pick up two of these now.There we go so.Now we are done.

We wanna sack yeah.Move to Fool's landing.Oh you gotta do your thing ta.I just get grab Coral Palace, too.Yep.There you go.Thank you.Then I'll be on Fool's Landing.(Tighter and stuff).And here is your thing. When it gets your turn, Engineer?.So just need three of those gets --.To get over there I might I am going to use helicopter.We can.Before your turn.Well you have helicopter anyways.Yeah.Yeah we have three helicopters so we are pretty good shape right now.You wanna helicopter here?.Are we play (it wrong)?.Bless you.Thank you.Do we miss someting?.No.Oh.Oh that's right.(Drag).Which tile tile over there?.Because we weren't together.My bad.And he gave me two cards.We weren't together.So you gave me two cards.Oh.Oh crap.And then even know he wasn't they were on the same tile. weren't they?.No.Oh you are right.Cuz then he moved.I can.One helicopter move.And then (he).Over and then gave you two cards that's the end of my.Okay.Oh okay that's end of turn okay.Okay.my three turns.Okay.So instead of Fool's Landing you are just going to the same place.That's what it was.Yeah.Okay.Yeah.I keep forgeting that.Alright so we are okay now.Tidal.Bronze Gate.And then oh.Coral Palace.That's one yeah.I can fix that.We need that.Yeah.Yeah well we wanna the second one I get the treasure well that's not the one I have to go all the way.Yeah.Okay.It's fine it's fine though cuz you are getting.Yeah.Okay.Okay so.Let's see. I am up now.You have to be on.I have to go all the way to that one. Don't I?.There.Why don't we use one of the helicoprters.Oops sorry.Yeah (--) use.Yeah.So I mean I could use my helicopter right now.Yeah for me to get me to the --.Get you here.Uh huh.(Ta).Yeah that's -- My first turn is collecting the treasure.So get rid of that card.I pick a treasure that's two turns.Which is that one. Well helicopter does not count as one yeah.Right or no he doesn't count as a turn okay as a move.No.And (--) that. That's one turn.Then.Two turns then. Should I flip this or do you want should I move here.Should probably. Well you can use sandbags if you want. I can just move on Fool's Landing and we are (good) to go.Just move to the Fool's Landing I think.Okay.(--).Go diagonal right. You can move diagonal so you can --.Yep I can ove diagonal.Alright.That's right you got a treasure.So.Yeah.Go ahead there.Okay.So then ah I put two cards. Before we do the flood warning, we should probably do sandbags on Coral Palace cuz we are gonna need that.I didn't get flood warning and (flame).Okay.Though should I (--).I mean we don't have to use it. She can probably cuz I have to pull three cards.Okay.Oh.But it's impossible to get Coral Palace because we've already put that one so --.Watch Tower.It's Watch Tower, Misty Marsh.Yeah.And --.Misty Marsh.And Temple of the Sun.Temple --.Got it.Yeah it's on there. Okay, let's go back over there and it's your turn.Alright.So you have you can get that one.Ah I need to be where.I can use a helicopter move you over Whispering Garden.Yeah that's gonna a bus but --.That way you just use your one turn.Alright.So then we need that last (turn).I gonna save this to get out of here.Yeah.Yeah.Oh I am going here.So your first move would be collecting eh --.Get rid of the helicopters I will put it here.Oh.Okay.(--).This is my first move.I've gotta three of these. Now everyone needs to get to the right place.And then.Wait.Em.Where did you hold on a second where did you come from?.Pretty much.For your next two moves.Mm.She came from here.She came from there.(--).I just cuz I just.Alright.I don't know if you guys would wanna like back track but I was just thinking.She just wanna go here.Fool's Landing. I mean I have these and it only takes one step I don't need helicopter.Yeah let's set that, too.But it doesn't matter. We can do whatever.Cuz now we have to go all the way back around for her to get.You guys wanna -- we can do a four treasures.Back here.Oh it's true.Well then she still gotta we gotta three moves so she can move here. You have to flip that yeah.Yeah only used one.Right I used one move.To get the treauser so you can --.Yeah but I still can't I need to get there.But but we (--).Yeah.You know what I mean? We have to go all the way back on the board though. So if instead we do not use the helicopter on her and she just wants here. I have the four thing and I could just do that instead.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah we can (at least) do that.Okay so I am back (talking) give me this.Should we just do that thing?.Can we do that?.Sorry for back tracking but I just thought of it.That's fine. Never mind.Alright.Yeah.Okay.So instead.I'll take the helicopter off.Okay.You started here.Uh huh.And --.What's then what we were doing then?.How about if I just turn tiles. Cuz I can wait we are gonna need them. I can turn two tiles with my power, my super powers.She can go anywhere doesn't matter yeah.Yeah.Yeah.I think it's important.Yeah that's a Coral Palance.One.And then you should do two moves to get on Fool's Landing okay.And then I can do one two.Alright.Kay.Oh that does --.So now.No it's hopefully nothing well.And then three flood cards. Oh flood rises though.Oh I need another helicopter see ta.Ah.Nice.Ah shit.That's fine though we should be we should be okay.Oh but it is still risky.Can I say that in this experiment?.Oh my god.Okay no swearing aloud. Does that was in the rule?.Then I gave some interesting though.To trade that?.Wait you have to shuffle.Now some.Oh.Oh (goodness).Yeah we do cuz this is flood warning.Wait.Here you go you can shuffle.Sorry.So yeah shuffle this.(Bad) that might our last.And then nothing really needs to get sandbags just be allowed us to flood.Our last one.Three yeah.Alright.Tidal Palace.Oh right here. So the Tidal Palace is gone.That's gone.Cliffs of Abandon.That's flooded.So keep that one over there.Whispering Garden.(Get) worse.Here it is.That one right there.Okay.Okay cool.Okay.Go.So my turn.Alright so.Yeah.Yeah I need to (shut up) the game.Oh wait I gotta put the (--) back.Oh.You can only have five cards in your hand.Oh this right here.Oh.So yeah just get around the chalice or something.Alright.Em I don't have a child.Just get rid of one of the.Over that that is.To get rid of this cuz I am not gonna need it.TWe are now the chalice the statue.(Forget).The lion.Just get rid of one of the (dudes) cuz I got.Yeah.Yeah.Do we have.Yeah.Yeah we are good I have these too.We don't need that one.Yeah.Okay.Alright now it's my turn.So.I am going to make my first.Move there.Get the treasure.Then I am going to.So we got the treasure.And then you don't mind (if I ask me).And now.I guess should I go to.Uh huh.Fool's Landing that's my last move.Yeah.OYep last move and then do a helicopter lift.Oh.WOh let's see.NnMm.She has to finish a turn.No because.Yeah that's true.Right?.Yeah.Either way.Yeah.Right these (are not gonna) really need them anyway.I can just move there.And --.Where are we, we are still on three.Or anytime.

Team4401.csv,"ok.You only lose if there's no tile you can swim to, right.Ok, forgot about that..Mmhmm.Yeah.If.Clicks.If there's one like adjacent, or diagonal to you, sorry.Then you can't get there.So.Yeah, cause only the explorer moves diagonally.Yeah..Ok.So.I have these two cards and.I'm right here so I'm gonna turn over.Mhm..Lost Lagoon and Temple of the Moon.That rhymed.That was one action.I'm going to.move another one and then.You can move there and shore those two up too..yep.Nice..just keeping it safe.alright.Thanks.Hmm.Mhm..Thanks.so two.oh, wait, nope I have to shuffle these.yeah, here we go.Oh..I don't remember.Temple of the Moon and the Cliffs of Abandon.So I'm on.the Temple of the Moon.And then.Ok.Alright, my turn..Uh.So I think I'm just gonna shore up the ones that you just turned over.Cause I don't have a whole lot of useful things to do -.right now, so -.unless you guys can think of something.Oh. No you're good..Okay..One.Two.Three..And then two of these..Breakers Bridge and Phantom Rock.Alright. We lost Phantom Rock..Oh no..Alright. Um..Uh I guess I'll just like.shore up Breaker's Bridge..Can you do that?.And.If he flies there..if I like fly over there I could..Oh, got it..Yeah..That's pretty cool Pilot..We could just go anywhere..Mhm..I think it's kinda nice that we got the Water's Rise out of the way like-.Hm, shore that up..There's only a few of them.It's like, ok..Yeah..No big deal..Not too devastating at this point.So that's two moves and.yeah..I just chose that one because I feel like it's more important than the edge cause.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.but um.yeah I guess I'll just end my turn there and draw two..(--) and another Helicopter lift..Just keep getting those helicopters.Nice.and then draw two of these..Gold Gate.and Lost Lagoon. So I guess we did lose that..We didn't lose Lost Lagoon.Cool..Ok..Hm..I'm gonna want to make my way over to Coral Palace.Umm, where's the -.Oh.Hmm.Which one's Coral Palace. Oh okay..Right here..I'm gonna just go one.Pretty good move..two.Thank you..Oh nice..And thats five..Hmm.Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.Umm.Thank you.Umm..Should I maybe use my Sandbag to shore up Whispering Garden.It'd probably be a good move. Just in case you draw a flood card..Yeah..Ok, so that doesn't count as an action..Mmhmm.It's not real urgent at this point-.I have it, I might as well use it..Mhm..Mhm..Umm, let's see.So I've got two of these Lions.Mhm..I'm gonna start heading for them.The Gardens..So I can get it if I -.Get two more..Hmm.Do you want to go South or North?.South might be better cause we haven't draw drew a flood card for it yet..That's true..So there's like less chance of that getting shored up. Plus she's near it..Yeah..Okay..So-.One.Two.Three..Ok.Shuffle these..Temple of the Moon, Breaker's Bridge, and Lost Lagoon..Hm..Okay so I was thinking I would give her the chalice.but.uh what.card do you think she should get rid of?.Does it matter? Or.Mmm.Like fire or stone cause you got one of each right?.Well there's, I'd probably say get rid of the Fire because we've got three of te purple ones in play and only two of those..Oh yeah cause.yeah..Ok.That's a good idea..Alright so I will.fly over to you and give you that..Thank you..And that was two..I was thinking-.Um-.Well-.You already moved but-.Maybe before you flew you could have like.whatever it really doesn't matter.Well actually that was kinda just a normal move. I only moved one square..Yeah.So I mean I could still fly if I wanted too..Oh yeah.But.I don't know where I would go..Yeah..Alright so I guess I'll just done my turn..You could shore up something..Oh yeah..Yeah you might as well since you got one turn left..Eh shore up.Breaker's Bridge..And I got Lion and Sandbags so I have five cards now..Mhm..And draw three of these..Iron Gate.

No you're good.Okay.One.Two.Three.And then two of these.Breakers Bridge and Phantom Rock.Alright. We lost Phantom Rock.Oh no.Alright. Um.Uh I guess I'll just like.shore up Breaker's Bridge.Can you do that?.And.If he flies there.if I like fly over there I could.Oh, got it.Yeah.That's pretty cool Pilot.We could just go anywhere.Mhm.I think it's kinda nice that we got the Water's Rise out of the way like-.Hm, shore that up.There's only a few of them.It's like, ok.Yeah.No big deal.Not too devastating at this point.So that's two moves and.yeah.I just chose that one because I feel like it's more important than the edge cause.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.but um.yeah I guess I'll just end my turn there and draw two.(--) and another Helicopter lift.Just keep getting those helicopters.Nice.and then draw two of these.Gold Gate.and Lost Lagoon. So I guess we did lose that.We didn't lose Lost Lagoon.Cool.Ok.Hm.I'm gonna want to make my way over to Coral Palace.Umm, where's the -.Oh.Hmm.Which one's Coral Palace. Oh okay.Right here.I'm gonna just go one.Pretty good move.two.Thank you.Oh nice.And thats five.Hmm.Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.Umm.Thank you.Umm.Should I maybe use my Sandbag to shore up Whispering Garden.It'd probably be a good move. Just in case you draw a flood card.Yeah.Ok, so that doesn't count as an action.Mmhmm.It's not real urgent at this point-.I have it, I might as well use it.Mhm.Mhm.Umm, let's see.So I've got two of these Lions.Mhm.I'm gonna start heading for them.The Gardens.So I can get it if I -.Get two more.Hmm.Do you want to go South or North?.South might be better cause we haven't draw drew a flood card for it yet.That's true.So there's like less chance of that getting shored up. Plus she's near it.Yeah.Okay.So-.One.Two.Three.Ok.Shuffle these.Temple of the Moon, Breaker's Bridge, and Lost Lagoon.Hm.Okay so I was thinking I would give her the chalice.but.uh what.card do you think she should get rid of?.Does it matter? Or.Mmm.Like fire or stone cause you got one of each right?.Well there's, I'd probably say get rid of the Fire because we've got three of te purple ones in play and only two of those.Oh yeah cause.yeah.Ok.That's a good idea.Alright so I will.fly over to you and give you that.Thank you.And that was two.I was thinking-.Um-.Well-.You already moved but-.Maybe before you flew you could have like.whatever it really doesn't matter.Well actually that was kinda just a normal move. I only moved one square.Yeah.So I mean I could still fly if I wanted too.Oh yeah.But.I don't know where I would go.Yeah.Alright so I guess I'll just done my turn.You could shore up something.Oh yeah.Yeah you might as well since you got one turn left.Eh shore up.Breaker's Bridge.And I got Lion and Sandbags so I have five cards now.Mhm.And draw three of these.Iron Gate.

Yeah. Alright..And then that's all the action I'm gonna take this turn. There's really not much else to do..Then I have the Lion's Statue and Waters Rise-.so we're gonna move that up a tick mark, shuffle the deck-.uh and then we'll-.take the (-) cards..Mm.Yup..Ok..And then we have Whispering Garden-.a Lost Lagoon-.and Temple of the Moon.So that was a good move with the Sandbag there..Lost Lagoon.Lost Lagoon is there..Yeah..Ok..Ok so for my move-.I'm gonna-.give you this-.Mmkay and I have to get rid of this..Yeah. That's a good one. Oop-.(Ow) just gonna-.Does that go there?.Mmhmm!.Ok yeah. And then I'm gonna move here and shore this up. Is that a good plan?.Yeah.(Yeah).Ok cool..Ok- oh wait a second. Do you have one more action?.No cause I gived, I moved, and I shored up..Ok..Gived. Gave..Gave..Gave..Yeah it's o- doesn't matter..I gived!.Three, four, five-.(-).Oh wait let's see um- yeah..K. Iron Gate is gone-.Iron Gate is gone-.Oh. (-).Then Breaker's Bridge and Cliffs of Abandon it looks like..Cliffs of Abandon is there. (-).Yeah. I have the discard over here. Yeah..Ok.Ok.So I'm going-.What you should do-.Is shore up now?.Shore up, move, and then cash in the treasure..Good idea..Ok..Move. Yeah..Ok so that was three-.Here are you're cards-.Thank you..So you have the stone and that. Ok. Hmm. Alright..So I have-.Crimson Forest-.Howling Garden-.And Copper Gate..Oh yeah..Ok..Let's see is it my turn then?.Yes..Let's see. Um. Hmm..I'm thinking what we might wanna do i-.Do you wanna give-move to where I am, give your cards to me, and then I can give my cards to him and he can get down here on that turn..No what I think I'll do is I'll just give my cards to him first just because it won't take-it won't take me two turns this way and then- Since I don't really have any more useful functions at the moment..Oh yeah that's true..So that'll be two. I can move somewhere, but I don't know if that's gonna be useful to anyone. So here's-.Ok..Two actions..Ok..Um-.Don't think a third would be useful at this point..Where-Where are you on the board?.Ok (so I)-.I am at the Coral Palace at the moment..Yeah you're fine then..Yeah. Ok..So I'm not gonna move- take my third turn..Ok..So here I have this and then we have waters rising again. Because I'm just unlucky that way..Mm..So three.Oh no.(Mm) shuffle deck of cards (then uh).Guess we can move this to the discard a while..Ok..So then-Oh yeah. Back on here. Then I take three. So here we have Copper Gate.(Mm).Uh Cliffs of Abandon.And Breaker's Bridge..(Hmm).Where is Cliffs of Abandon?.Down right here. And then Breaker's Bridge.Can I have Copper Gates? Card?.Oh yeah sure..Ok so-.I'm gonna use the sand bag and shore up- Which one should I-.We don't need this..Let's see..Well I mean yeah we don't-.So yeah we'll- We'll do that one yeah..Should I do this one? Just for-.Ok..So that's one.That's- That doesn't count as an action..You're right. Ok. So-.Ok so you're gonna wanna get with the Engineer..(Can)-.I'm gonna like move to you..Do you wanna shore up anything while you're there or not?.Uh yeah let's see..I can't do- I can move and I can give them to you-Er That wasn't an action. Yeah I can shore something up. Should I shore up the one I'm on? Probably cause it's like more-.Mhmm..(-)Yeah sure that's a good idea. It doesn't really matter if we lose the Lagoon..Center..K..So that's one.You can't go diagonal..Two. I can fly though. (I'll) fly diagonally..Oh..She can- Yeah..Great. That's awesome..Mhmm..Can I have your card?.And-.That's three. Yeah..Three..Ok..(-) Ok..Dang..And then-.(Gonna) draw three so we have Crimson Forest, Whispering Gardens-.Oh yeah you have to get rid of one of those (and pick)..Hm..Yep..Alright..Sorry Whispering Gardens, Crimson Forest, Howling-.Garden..Can I have Crimson Forest?.Yeah..Ok..So.I'm going.Alright.I'm gonna move..Yeah.(I can't).really do anything.Move here..Get that..And then-.I should just move-.Move back probably just-.Back..Oh shoot yeah..What?.Too late..What?.Sorry I was just thinking he probably should have given you his wind card but it's-it's too late at this point cause if he moves back then that will already be an action..Yeah.Cause we have all four of the lions but we might-.Oh.Yeah-.We're not- Anyways. Well there's nothing we can do now..That's ok..So I'll go back..Nope..Ok..Nope. Just didn't see it in time..Hopefully those don't both-.Yeah..No we'll see- We'll see what we can do..Wait we need to watch for that..So can I have two cards please?.Yeah..Ok..For some reason those-.And three..The good thing is (we're) already pulled up so until we get another card that will-.Lost Lagoon.Can I have that?.Hm..Yeah..That's-.Oh.Lost Lagoon.Ok..Temple of the Moon what do you think?.I-I need like the card. To discard it..Oh ok..And Lost Lagoon..Uh ok here..Ok..I also got rid of two tiles then. Ok..Yeah-.Uh ok so is it my turn then?.Probably should have gave you my lion..Yeah.No it's ok I didn't see it in time..We'll be ok. Um.Ok so it's my turn then. Yeah I'm gonna move-.Ye- Do you wanna move here and shore that up?.I'm gonna move- Shore up two. Wait. No I can't..Yeah you can't shore up two..I'll just move- I'll just move this one then. So that's two..Good idea.And then three will be giving you this card..And since you're already on the same tile it'll work well with the exchange..Ok..Yeah.Ok.Ok. Oh yeah! Treasure cards then. Since that was three..So I have- then that will (be)- bring my total up to four. And then hold on first we're gonna have to-.Ok here how bout-.Does anyone- yeah I'll have to flood this first and then you can probably use one of your special cards in order to do something here..Yeah that would be helpful.So Silver Gate.Yeah.Um Dunes of Deception, and Coral Palace..Coral Palace is here..Ok.Um.Yeah.Ok. Here's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking-.I should-.Do you wanna fl-.Go here,.fly you here,.Give me your cards?.Wait..Or-.I-Is Is each card- Is each card one action? This is something I need to know..I mean I could do that..This doesn't count as an action..No no no no no I mean giving him a card..Oh.Giving one card- Yeah. Giving a treasure card is one action. So in order to give him-.Does a single tresure-.Yes. So in order to give him all three treasure cards you're gonna have to use three actions. And then since this-this doesn't count as an action so you can fly him to the location..That's-.Ok so. That's- that's fine. I'll give you all three of these..Yeah.So that's three actions..And then I'll fly you-.Here..Ok..Yeah..Thank you..Ok go ahead and do you're stuff..Mmhmm.Ok..Yeah..Oh gosh.Oh yeah. Just try to watch that I guess..I had more than what-.Oh ok..Just get rid of all of them..Oh..Yeah. Ok..Ok..Can I have three of those?.Yeah..Yup..So.Temple of the Lo- Sun..Tidal Place.Got it..and Bronze Gate..Mm Tidal's up there. Yeah..Bronze Gate..Ok so I'm going to-.cash in..Right away..And now we need to start running back..Oh ok we do have three don't we..So that's one action..Yeah..Then let's see. You can be there in two actions..I could or I could-.Oh wait..No-.Oh no you can't sorry..I was looking at the wrong piece..Do you wanna-.No I couldn't. Should I shore up one and just move one?.Eh.Do- Yeah do you wanna move here and then shore up so that like those don't sink?.Oh that's a good idea..So-.Yeah..This would be.Move-.Move here and then shore those two..Move one shore up two. Yeah..And-.That's all I can do..Ok..Ok..So.Then oh!.Can you shore up two?.Yeah.Mmhmm.Helicopter, Water rising.And this goes back there.Yeah ok.Yeah.So Whispering Garden.Breaker's Bridge and Cave of Embers.Cave-.Can I have Cave of Embers?.Yes.(Here you go).Ok..Then let's see. I doesn't look like I'm gonna need to shore anything up so I guess I'll just use my two moves to get to Fool's Landing..So one, two..Ok..And then-.(Dole) two treasure cards-.Cards..Ok then I'll just discard one of them randomly.and then (We were) at three this time so that would be Dunes of Deception, Bronze Gate, and Howling Garden..Three-.Bronze Gate..And- Yeah..Uh can I have all of them..Alright..I'm gonna fly you-.Wait..I'm gonna fly you here with it. No! I can't..Yeah y- Why not?.I have one..Ye-.(-) Then you can- Yeah you can do it on your next turn. Ok. So I'm gonna fly you here..Ok..I'm gonna move here..Mmhmm..Yep..So that's two- Er no just one..And that's.it..And then-.Yeah..You gotta pick up your cards..Mmhmm..And then that's the game..Not quite but yeah..Almost..Yeah..Yup.Yeah sorry..Ye-.You're good..Um Silver Gate-.Coral Palace-.Coral Palace- Oop! There we go..and Temple of the Sun..Yeah..Trade me..And then you can fly us out of here..K I'm gonna use my helicopter.

Do you have one more action?.No cause I gived, I moved, and I shored up.Ok.Gived. Gave.Gave.Gave.Yeah it's o- doesn't matter.I gived!.Three, four, five-.(-).Oh wait let's see um- yeah.K.

Yeah.Ok.Ok.So I'm going-.What you should do-.Is shore up now?.Shore up, move, and then cash in the treasure.Good idea.Ok.Move. Yeah.Ok so that was three-.Here are you're cards-.Thank you.So you have the stone and that. Ok. Hmm. Alright.So I have-.Crimson Forest-.Howling Garden-.And Copper Gate.Oh yeah.Ok.Let's see is it my turn then?.Yes.Let's see. Um.

Ok.So I'm not gonna move- take my third turn.Ok.So here I have this and then we have waters rising again. Because I'm just unlucky that way.Mm.So three.Oh no.(Mm) shuffle deck of cards (then uh).Guess we can move this to the discard a while.Ok.So then-Oh yeah. Back on here. Then I take three. So here we have Copper Gate.(Mm).Uh Cliffs of Abandon.And Breaker's Bridge.(Hmm).Where is Cliffs of Abandon?.Down right here. And then Breaker's Bridge.Can I have Copper Gates? Card?.Oh yeah sure.Ok so-.I'm gonna use the sand bag and shore up- Which one should I-.We don't need this.Let's see.Well I mean yeah we don't-.So yeah we'll- We'll do that one yeah.Should I do this one?

So-.Ok so you're gonna wanna get with the Engineer.(Can)-.I'm gonna like move to you.Do you wanna shore up anything while you're there or not?.Uh yeah let's see.I can't do- I can move and I can give them to you-Er That wasn't an action. Yeah I can shore something up. Should I shore up the one I'm on? Probably cause it's like more-.Mhmm.(-)Yeah sure that's a good idea. It doesn't really matter if we lose the Lagoon.Center.K.So that's one.You can't go diagonal.Two. I can fly though. (I'll) fly diagonally.Oh.She can- Yeah.Great. That's awesome.Mhmm.Can I have your card?.And-.That's three. Yeah.Three.Ok.(-) Ok.Dang.And then-.(Gonna) draw three so we have Crimson Forest, Whispering Gardens-.Oh yeah you have to get rid of one of those (and pick).Hm.Yep.Alright.Sorry Whispering Gardens, Crimson Forest, Howling-.Garden.Can I have Crimson Forest?.Yeah.Ok.So.I'm going.Alright.I'm gonna move.Yeah.(I can't).really do anything.Move here.Get that.And then-.I should just move-.Move back probably just-.Back.Oh shoot yeah.What?.Too late.What?.Sorry I was just thinking he probably should have given you his wind card but it's-it's too late at this point cause if he moves back then that will already be an action.Yeah.Cause we have all four of the lions but we might-.Oh.Yeah-.We're not- Anyways. Well there's nothing we can do now.That's ok.So I'll go back.Nope.Ok.Nope. Just didn't see it in time.Hopefully those don't both-.Yeah.No we'll see- We'll see what we can do.Wait we need to watch for that.So can I have two cards please?.Yeah.Ok.For some reason those-.And three.The good thing is (we're) already pulled up so until we get another card that will-.Lost Lagoon.Can I have that?.Hm.Yeah.That's-.Oh.Lost Lagoon.Ok.Temple of the Moon what do you think?.I-I need like the card. To discard it.Oh ok.And Lost Lagoon.Uh ok here.Ok.I also got rid of two tiles then. Ok.Yeah-.Uh ok so is it my turn then?.Probably should have gave you my lion.Yeah.No it's ok I didn't see it in time.We'll be ok. Um.Ok so it's my turn then. Yeah I'm gonna move-.Ye- Do you wanna move here and shore that up?.I'm gonna move- Shore up two. Wait. No I can't.Yeah you can't shore up two.I'll just move- I'll just move this one then. So that's two.Good idea.And then three will be giving you this card.And since you're already on the same tile it'll work well with the exchange.Ok.Yeah.Ok.Ok. Oh yeah! Treasure cards then. Since that was three.So I have- then that will (be)- bring my total up to four. And then hold on first we're gonna have to-.Ok here how bout-.Does anyone- yeah I'll have to flood this first and then you can probably use one of your special cards in order to do something here.Yeah that would be helpful.So Silver Gate.Yeah.Um Dunes of Deception, and Coral Palace.Coral Palace is here.Ok.Um.Yeah.Ok. Here's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking-.I should-.Do you wanna fl-.Go here,.fly you here,.Give me your cards?.Wait.Or-.I-Is Is each card- Is each card one action? This is something I need to know.I mean I could do that.This doesn't count as an action.No no no no no I mean giving him a card.Oh.Giving one card- Yeah. Giving a treasure card is one action. So in order to give him-.Does a single tresure-.Yes. So in order to give him all three treasure cards you're gonna have to use three actions. And then since this-this doesn't count as an action so you can fly him to the location.That's-.Ok so. That's- that's fine. I'll give you all three of these.Yeah.So that's three actions.And then I'll fly you-.Here.Ok.Yeah.Thank you.Ok go ahead and do you're stuff.Mmhmm.Ok.Yeah.Oh gosh.Oh yeah. Just try to watch that I guess.I had more than what-.Oh ok.Just get rid of all of them.Oh.Yeah. Ok.Ok.Can I have three of those?.Yeah.Yup.So.Temple of the Lo- Sun.Tidal Place.Got it.and Bronze Gate.Mm Tidal's up there. Yeah.Bronze Gate.Ok so I'm going to-.cash in.Right away.And now we need to start running back.Oh ok we do have three don't we.So that's one action.Yeah.Then let's see. You can be there in two actions.I could or I could-.Oh wait.No-.Oh no you can't sorry.I was looking at the wrong piece.Do you wanna-.No I couldn't. Should I shore up one and just move one?.Eh.Do- Yeah do you wanna move here and then shore up so that like those don't sink?.Oh that's a good idea.So-.Yeah.This would be.Move-.Move here and then shore those two.Move one shore up two. Yeah.And-.That's all I can do.Ok.Ok.So.Then oh!.Can you shore up two?.Yeah.Mmhmm.Helicopter, Water rising.And this goes back there.Yeah ok.Yeah.So Whispering Garden.Breaker's Bridge and Cave of Embers.Cave-.Can I have Cave of Embers?.Yes.(Here you go).Ok.Then let's see. I doesn't look like I'm gonna need to shore anything up so I guess I'll just use my two moves to get to Fool's Landing.So one, two.Ok.And then-.(Dole) two treasure cards-.Cards.Ok then I'll just discard one of them randomly.and then (We were) at three this time so that would be Dunes of Deception, Bronze Gate, and Howling Garden.Three-.Bronze Gate.And- Yeah.Uh can I have all of them.Alright.I'm gonna fly you-.Wait.I'm gonna fly you here with it. No! I can't.Yeah y- Why not?.I have one.Ye-.(-) Then you can- Yeah you can do it on your next turn. Ok. So I'm gonna fly you here.Ok.I'm gonna move here.Mmhmm.Yep.So that's two- Er no just one.And that's.it.And then-.Yeah.You gotta pick up your cards.Mmhmm.And then that's the game.Not quite but yeah.Almost.Yeah.Yup.Yeah sorry.Ye-.You're good.Um Silver Gate-.Coral Palace-.Coral Palace- Oop! There we go.and Temple of the Sun.Yeah.Trade me.And then you can fly us out of here.K I'm gonna use my helicopter. (I'm -) move and fly us away. sd  b  b  sv  fc  b  sd  ba  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  %  sd  %  b  %  sd  sv  fc  sd  ba  sd  qw  sd  b  sd  %  nn  %  sd  sd  nn  nn  b  sd  ^h  %  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  %  qy  sv  %  b  sd  aa  aa  %  sd  %  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  qw  %  b  qy  b  sd  sd  ba  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  %  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  qy  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  ad  sd  sd  qy  qy  sd  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  qy  b  sd  b  b  bk  qy  sd  b  sd  %  %  aa  %  sd  %  ^h  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  qw  qy  sd  ba  b  b  sd  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  b^m  sd  b  b  qy  ny  ^h  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  b  sd  b  %  sv  qw  sd  sd  ba  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  ba  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  qw  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  ^h  sd  sd  qy  b  sd  sv  aa  sv  %  sd  qy  ^h  sd  b  sv  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  ba  b  qy  %  sd  sd  b  b  ba  %  sd  sv  %  b  b  sd  b^m  sd  b  b  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  qy  sd  ba  %  sd  sd  sd  b  %  ^2  %  sv  b  sd  b  b  sv  bd  sd  nn  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  b  %  b  sd  b  qo  sd  b  sd  %  b  sd  b  qy  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sv  sd  ba  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  qo  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  %  b  sd  sd  qy  sd  ad  br  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  qy  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  fc  ad  b  b  b  ba  sd  sd  b  sv  b  b  b  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  nn  sd  sd  qy  sd  %  qy  ba  %  b  %  bf  sd  sd  %  sd  b  b  %  b  qy  b  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  ny  sd  b  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  %  sd  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  b  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  %  b  b  sd  b  ba  b  sd  sd  sd  b  ad  sd  sd",0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.25  0.7  0.25  0.5  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.3  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.2857142857142857  0.0  0.3  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.3  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.25  -0.0062500000000000056  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.05  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.1  0.35  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.05  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.4  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  0.7  0.1  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.15625  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.2  0.0  0.35  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.1  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.15555555555555559  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.6  0.0  0.0  0.425  0.275  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.15555555555555559  0.3125  0.35  0.3  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.15  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.4166666666666667  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.06507936507936506  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.3125  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.1  0.2857142857142857  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.3  0.0  0.4666666666666666  -0.1  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.8  0.0  0.0  0.9  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.2  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.3  0.0  -0.17500000000000002  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.125  0.5  0.3035714285714286  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.8  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.1  -0.3125  0.1  0.15625  0.0  0.1  -0.07142857142857142  0.45  0.0  0.45833333333333337  0.0  0.0  0.8  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.2857142857142857  0.0  0.5  0.1  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.5  -0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.7  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.8  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.4  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.4  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  -0.5  0.0  0.7  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.8  0.8

It goes novice, normal, elite, and legendary and then nothing.Just two.Oh.(Just).Ok, wait.Um, I didn't really see what it was.That's fine.Ok.(It's) the top two.Um, Gold Gate and Phantom Rock.Well-.They're both gone.Ok.Ok.That's what happens.Alright.Alright.Let's see here, I'm gray.You-.I can give cards away.Yeah.You want purple?.You wanna give the chalice to her maybe? And I'll take the-.Earth.Well I can only have- I mean, if I'm gonna do this guy, I can only have-.If I-.Um.Oh, ok.Five.At once.(--).What are you close to?.What are you clo-.On that-.(We're-).I-.Not far from here.(Not) far from there.Although, I can move diagonally, so I can really get all over the board.Fairly easily.That's true.Um.I'll take the earth one.I second that.Is that this guy?.That's fine.Yep.Purple.Alright, that's one move.Uh, there's nothing to shore up, even.(--).Wait, are you on the same- don't you have to be on the same thing to give it to him?.No.She's the-.Messenger.Oh.I get-.Special power.Ah ha- special power.Ok.Yeah.Um, and then maybe-.I mean, you're-.I can move towards the-.The chalice.Yeah, for the time being.And just do one, two.I think that's a good idea and then I'll give this to you.Can you move somewhere so that when I get-.You could get- I could-.Why don't you just move ont- onto her and then just call it there.I could move on onto here.Yeah, just so that we're all together. So that I don't have to move one- like, use a move to get to you.Yep.Alright.Yep.I'd say that's-.Right, I'm done, ok.I got a sandbag.And another-.Perfect. Ok.Purple.(Oh, we can-).Earth.Alright.Thing.

Ok, so if we think ahead- so what-.True.One, two, three.Well I can fly anywhere, so it doesn't matter.(But)-.That's true, you could.For me.And-.Wait, does your flying count as a move? I forget.Yes.Ok.Yeah.But you could come here and do two and then put-.Lost Lagoon back.Yeah, 'cause then you're still one, two-.Get the-.Get the treasure.So I think if you're within two moves of that-.Mmhmm.You can- you (could)-.I can just take it one (at a) time.Comfortably stay there, yeah.Ok.Oh, and shore that.Ok.Thank you.Now we have to start thinking about-.Not ending up with five of these, oh well.Water's rise, yeah.Hmm.Ok.(You'll be that) up one.Shuffle these guys up.You know what they all are.Lower in (priority).We could use a sandbag.Um.Next turn I'll be here and I'll be just as close to that, anyway, if I'm-.Ok.Uh we need to start getting-.Right.I have one to give you.Those to me, if we wanna, yeah.Yeah.You wanna, take your three?.So we're saving our sandbag?.Yeah, that's fine.I would say.Um.I'm ok with that.(Agreed).Um Lost Lagoon, Iron Gate, and Breakers Bridge.Gate's out.Mmhmm.(Gate).Ok.I can give you the purple.Yeah, why don't you do that.And then-.One-.Mm.Wait.(--).What?.You don't want do it?.Well you would nn-.Oh, I need to-.I need to keep this so that I can give it to you.You could discard a lion.So, I'll have- the only thing I can do is get rid of the lion.Yeah, you could because you have-.That's-.I'm ok with that.That's fine. We'll get more of something.Yeah, (--) it's unfortunate but that's kinda-.Yeah.Alright, and then-.I think-.Let's see, I'm gray so-.Either I- I wanna-.I wanna shore up Breakers Bridge, right?.Yeah.Mmhmm.You could move up and do one, two.Move up and-.Well, I already did one move.And then-.And then you're at- th- that would be three.Oh, yeah, you're right.This would be three, here.Yep.Ok.I got another sandbag.And I got a purple.Earth.Um.Three of these.Got Cliffs of Abandon-.Temple of the Moon-.Alright.That one's gone.And Whispering Garden.Which is where you guys are.That's this one.I think we should use the sandbags.For?.Um.Definitely this.Yeah.Or that.And-.Well it's- it's out now. So we can wait until we get another Waters Rise.Well-.Yeah, that's true.Ok.Let's just not forget.Yeah.Alright, it's your turn.Alright.Pilot.Oh.I need to give this-.To the Engineer.So I need to move there.So you need-.One.Two.Thank you.Then you wanna shore up Whispering Garden.And shore-.Maybe shore up both those?.Well he only has one more move.I have one move left.(Miss).One more move.I- I keep forgetting.Trading counts as a move, yeah.The Whispering Garden.Ok.Alright.Ok.Copper Gate.Crimson Forest.Mm.Oh.Oh it's right there.It's the Copper Gate.Oh.And then the-.Howling Garden.Ok, so I'm going to get this to you.I'm not-.I can get this to you.One, two.And-.You can shore up Cliffs of Abandon if you want to.I can shore both those.Or Lost-.I would-.My guess is that this one's probably more valuable to use bcause it's more in the middle, around these guys.Ok.Yeah.Than out here, on the edge.Yeah, you coul-.(No, I, uh)-.But if you just-.One.You already used two moves.Two actions.Right, but he can shore up diagonally.Yeah.But you can still shore up.Yeah.The one-.Yeah.Mmhmm.Cool.Cool.Did you get your cards yet?.No.No.Now, between the two of you-.One of you should get the moon guy.To me, next turn.(--).I can do that 'cause I don't have to be on the same spot as you.So-.I got a waters rise.Oh.NnMm.Oh no.There, you need to-.Bump that up.Yes.Do we wanna use any sandbag?.We have two.Um.Before you pick your cards.Actually, yeah.Personally, I think we should use them both-.Even though that's getting- it's like using them, because-.Yeah.We have four things flipped over and we really don't want Fool's Landing to become one of the things, even though it hasn't come up yet. And those seem to be-.Yeah.Right.Frequent.Ok.So let's-.So I think we should use them.Those two?.Yes.I agree with Howling Garden.Sure.Then- yeah, may as well just-.That one.And then, what? That one?.That (looks) fine.Sure.Yeah, that's more in the middle, ok.Probably won't matter too much but it'll keep it- keep it in the game a little bit.Alright.Eh.And-.Here's your three.(--).'Kay, Cliffs of Abandon, Howling Garden, there we go-.Mmhmm.And Lost Lagoon.That's gonna be lost.That's gone.Oh.Well, that happens.That's fine.Mm 'kay.Alright you-.Ok.Got your three moves, right?.You wanna get the red.You have to move first.Yes.Ok, so-.You wanna move one, two and turn it in.Um.That's really her only move.Yeah.Yeah.Gracias.Thank you.Ok, helicopter and a lion.Mm.Um.Oh.Now, ok so we can get the moon-.Or the-.The earth, purple.(For sure).Green.And then wha- I- we should-.(--).Decide if we wanna to try to get-.Either the chalice or the-.The chalicies or the lions.Yeah.My opinion is-.Probably the lions but-.But we'll do your-.Thing.One, two, three, one-.Alright.Go ahead.Um, Whispering Garden-.Copper Gate.And Crimson Forest.Alright.Ok.Alright.I can give you the purple one.Sure.And then, I think you should shore up.Somethine.Or do yuo think-.As much as you can, yeah.Or would you prefer that I move-.Shore up those two.Who am I? The gray?.I can move to Whispering Garden and shore up two with my three moves, or I can give you one-.'Cause you're already on my spot.I like that.Move and then shore up.Ok.Does everyone agree?.Yeah.Then you won't be able to trade?.(One).Yeah- but you can get yours.But yeah- but you have yours.I can- oh.And you're on the same spot.And you're already on my spot, yeah.Good point.Alright, blue, yeah.One, two, three. Yeah.Sounds good then.Ok.Oh, look that.I don't even need your-.Ok.Chalices.It'll decide for us.Excelent.As long as we can survive.Yep.Alright.I got Silver Gate.Cave of Embers.And Breakers Bridge.You need your flood cards.Oh wait, those were the flood cards that you turned over.Oh those were the flood cards- your turn.Yep.So you need-.I'm gonna give this-.Give me that.To you. Tha's one.(And) you're-.Blue, right?.I'm blue.I think you should do Breakers Bridge.Shore up.Do you guys all agree?.While you're there, yeah.Then I have one move left.And you can fly somewhere if you need to.Maybe.You should fly-.Using um-.Wait do the things count? I forget.The helicopters don't count, no.We have so many helicopters.I-.But he doesn't need the helicopter. He can go- he can fly-.But I don't need it.Yeah.I think you should fly somewhere and just shore another thing up.Well, he only has one move left.He only has one move left.I'd have to use a lift to.Yeah, 'cause we have three of th- we have three of them and we're really close to finishing so I think we should utilize them to save-.Oh ok.We have three lifts, good point.Yeah.Now we're-.Us from drowning.But I wo- we might- we might need the lifts.We don't need that.To get to the things.Right.I would say-.Move to Howling Garden.And then if it comes back around to you, you can always.Or one of these other guys, you can always-.Um.Flip them over when it comes back to your turn if they're still there.If it's- yeah.Might be swimming.I don't know. Or you can just go to Fool's Landing and be done.By then.We don't need either of those.Um.Well you can move anywhere, why don't you move to Howling Garden?.I'll move and then shore it up.(i).Well you-.You can't, you've already used-.Your three turns.Well, I gave him a card.And then I moved.That's one.No you, you shored up Breakers Bridge.Oh, did I?.Yeah (--).Someone has a five card-.And- and- you have six cards.Ok.Yeah, you're right.So, lose the fire.Don't need that.Don't need-.This either.Alright, so my turn as-.Far as actions is done, right?.That's three?.Yep.Alright.You can only keep.One of 'em.Oh.Don't-.Worry about-.That.You don't have to worry about any of 'em.I don't have to worry about either one?.Uh.So just pick one.Get rid of it.Ok, and then I need-.Flood cards.Let's see-.Bronze Gate.Coral Palace.And-.Coral Palace.Dunes of Deception.Oops.Those are new ones.(And) nothin'-.Alright.Haven't gotten a flood card in a while.Alright.I'm up.You're up.Let's get this.Mm I can move diagonally so that'll be one.One.Two.Two, 'cause we already lost the other one of those.And then three.Then we'll get this.Sounds good.Uhh that's three.Um.(--).Uh.How close are you-.Ok.Are you gonna-.Do the, um-.Coral one on the next turn- yeah, so I should-.Mmhmm.Pretty much just shore everything up.Yep.Yeah, well- oh wait, Tidal Palace.Tidal Palace.Yeah, you should go shorin' stuff up that-.To take-.Me back.Or, to get-.Ok.We could.To get the Explorer back and to get you back, I would do at least this one and this one.I would, um-.You could do those two, fly somewhere, do two more.Yeah, I was gonna say I could do these two-.Fly here-.Do these two.Uh.But you'd already have these two-.Or-.You're the red. You can do these two here-.Well, she would-.Those two and those two.No I was gonna say I can do these two.Oh ok.Then fly here and do these two.Or-.Whatever do you guys think is more-.Um-.Which one's-.I think you want to get onto Fool's Landing.To get outta here.Then you'll be- then you'll be within one turn of Fool's Landing, though.Oh yeah, that's true.Because you could do this here. You could do one-.Then you can move-.Here-.And then you can move here and have your three. But-.It's up to you.Yeah.Or you could do these two here, move here, and flip that one.Maybe. You definitely want to flip that one.Um.Just because-.We're close to-.Finishing, I think?.I think I should just-.Um-.Like just try and shore up as much as possible, yeah.That's fine.Ok.So I'm gonna do-.These two and then-.Use this 'cause we still have two of them and come here and do these two and then-.Yeah.'Cause then I'll be within-.aYep.(--).Able to get there.So ultimately, we're just getting all four.And this goes here.And then you can move-.If you want.She's already done. She did her three.Oh.Ok, so I got another lift, so that's good.Right.Well-.Or is there sti- no there's still one more, right? 'Cause you were, you did these two-.(--).Helicopter-.You used the helicopter to get there.You- you helicopter which isn't a move-.Well using-.Uh there still is one turn, that's right.That's two.Oh, it's not?.Yeah, you still have another.Oh.Ok.So you can still move one more.Why don't you move over here so that if we need you, you can-.Shore those up.Yeah.Cool.If it gets around.What'd you get? Another helicopter?.Helicopter-.And waters rise again.Hmm.Ooh.Ok.We don't have any sandbags to use, huh?.Guess we used 'em.Nope.(Oh yeah).Prioritize-.Obviously shoring up, and then just make sure no one drowns.And then just-.Get to the, Fool's Landing.Mmhmm.Yeah.I just need to get that one, the Chalice.Alright there (ya) go.You need to pick your three.Ok, Breakers bridge, Whispering Garden-.And Dunes of Deception.Whispering Garden.Nn Dunes, right there.Where's the Dunes of Deception?.Right down there.Alright.Alright, now's my turn. So I'll go one, two and get the-.Yep.The chal-.Mmhmm.(Sure).Alright.(Alright).We're still at three, huh?.Mmhmm.Yeah, we're at three.'Kay.We just gotta get there.Alright, Coral Palace-.Coral Palace-.Right here (--).That one's new.Bronze Gate.(--).Cave of Embers.(--).Go-.'Kay.Alright, Pilot.Fly yourself to Fool's Landing.Um.Maybe shore up-.Shore s- shore stuff up.Shore up, fly, shore up.Shore up here, fly there, shore up there.(Mm, uh-huh).Yeah.Yep.(--).Agreed.Mm alright.You gotta throw some stuff away.(I got that), I don't know- need, don't need that and (then a) sandbag.That's good.Um-.You're (gonna) need three of these (unless).I think we should use the sand bag.You wanna use the sandbag on something?.Yeah, you wan- yeah.Um.I forget what was particularly susceptible to-.Just-.Yeah, just take your pick at this point.Something that's not in there though, that we might get here.Yeah, so this-.We're all moving back towards Fool's Landing, right?.Mmhmm.We've got three helicopter lifts.We're good.One, two, three.We should be able to do all of this in one turn.Yeah.To finish this out.In your turn.Yeah, hold on to it then, 'cause you don't have to use it during your turn.That's true.That make sense?.Yep.(Bingo).Misty Marsh.Up there.Tidal Palace.Tidal Pal-.And Silver Gate.These two are gone.So-.Alright, we should be able to finish this out with yours.I think so.Because we've got three helicopter lifts. So you should be able to go one, two, three-.Yeah.We should be able to helicopter lift red-.Gray, and then helicopter lift off the island.Yep.Cool.Right?.Uh yeah, that makes sense to me.So, I can move diagonally, too, so-.Whenever.One, two-.And then-.And then you can use the two helicopter lifts to move gray and red in-.'Cause they can be use any time, and then one helicopter lift to lift us off the island.Toss those out.And then we get out of here.So these are all out.Yay.And that's it.Cool.Alright.That one went even better.Yes.Well it should've b  sd  b  sd  %  sd  bf  ^h  fa  qy  qy  b  ny

Team4752.csv,"Would you like to do the water level two?.Sure.She's the banker..Yeah.Ok.Ok..Alrighty Engineer..So. I need to take up three actions..Since you have two of these, I would get you a little closer to either this one or this one..Yeah.What I was thinking is I would-.flip these two, which is one turn-.take a step and flip those turn-.Mmhmm..and-.That's my three..So that's three..And then do the rest of it..Yeah.That sound good with everybody?.Yeah. I think- I think that's it..Yep..Does this (as) set up as the same as last time?.One, two-.No it's a little different..No, It's a little different..Is it?.Ok..I at first I did think it was..Yeah.Yeah cause I gotta head towards the fire. Where's the other one?.I think you can only move here..I'm sorry? Oh that's right thank you..Thank you you're-.The fire ones are here and down there..Yeah.Mmhmm.Ok so I'm collecting fire. What are your cards?.Oh my bad. Um I have a helicopter..A lion.Yeah.Ok.Alright so no other clear collectors yet..Right..Yeah cause the lion can go one way or the other..So I'll give you these-.Yeah.Oh no. He collects the lions, you collect these..Yeah..Ok so I have a c- oh damn it..Depending on-.Already!.Ok.No that goes over there..Oh that's right..You gotta move that little thingy up..Wee!.These get shuffled in and then I take two, right?.Yeah. Put them on top and take two..I mean I just realized. These five starting cards are the cards that were flipped already, right?.Yeah.Yeah.Boo.Two, huh?.The Lost Lagoon-.and Breaker's-.Oh those two cards are in the same place..Ok cool..Hmm.Wait do I need to pass- oh wait. I don't have any turns. That's right..Yeah.Your turn!.Alright..So yep..Um.Give a cuppy to him! Or not a cuppy. Him!.So what do you want me to do?.I'm not saying do it right now but at some point in time.You wanna give that to him.Yeah.You can just hold on to (him) for now..Where are you?.Ok..I'm right here. So-.There's nothing to flip..If I go-.I can just like-.mosey my way on down..Gradually..Yeah..Um.So that's one-.Is there any like, harm? In giving him-.No the only thing is I'm closer to this than you are..that card? Oh..Oh yeah you are..Oh! So (are) we gonna pass the cards-.I didn't even realize..that way!.We could..We could..Yeah we could do that..I never thought of that!.Depending.Do you want to-.I'd say-.I'm sorry go ahead..I was just gonna say just hang out there for now..Yeah..Well you took one turn right?.But-.Yeah she has taken one turn..Yeah..Mmhmm..Just consider this.but you collect the lions, you collect the cuppys, and I'll give you the cuppy and you give that to her..Just so we- We have-.So.So.Wait..Who's gonna collect-.you're gonna give that-.(--).So you wanna give-.him to me?.Correct?.She should give-.this to him..No he's close so she's gonna collect those..Oh that's right! I give you the cuppy! Oh wait-.Yeah well we're both r- we're-.Mmhmm.I was thinking like in terms-.I'm sorry..Wait you can't do that now but-.Yeah..You gotta give him the cuppy, cause you're gonna collects the cups. She's gonna collect these cause she's near it..Yeah.Ok.You're gonna collect these because that's what you have..Yeah.I mean I'm right here too-.Oh that's true you can-.If we think- I was thinking like-.And your lion's right there!.I just wouldn't-.I was thinking like in terms of turns-.Mmhmm.If-.if-.you give hime this-.Mmhmm..No. She's collecting those..Actually I did forget that you can move diagonally..Cause I can just move someone whenever.Because if- If he collects these-.and then he gives me this-.Uh huh..And then you give that- I mean I guess it doesn't matter now because none of us will have four yet..Oh yeah! It's- We're basically saying the same thing. It's- It's who's gonna collect cups and who's gonna collect this..So, it's-.Yeah.Yeah.I'd say for now just don't pass anything..Ok.Uh.Because we all- We all have one- I mean other than give you all the fires..I wouldn't-.Cause everybody else has one-.Well I know that but I- We need to start at a point sometime so instead of waiting-.and wasting a turn..I'd say as soon as somebody gets two-.then start passing to them..Ok.But if we pass to you then you have two!.You know what you're saving..Yeah but like if she passes to me and then draws another one right now.Mm It's up to you, it's up to you! Do whatever you wanna do!.I guess she can always give it to me. I don't know..For you passing's not a big deal so-.Oh that's right!.Yeah.Ok.I guess you can-.Um.No, no, no!.I think you shouldn't-.give anyone anything right now. Cause you can do it whenever..Yeah, yeah..Ok..When it comes to our turns we'll- we'll work on giving something to someone. Yeah..You're right. You're right..Thank you for pointing that out..Ok..So I think your turn should just stop..See I think I know everything but I don't..Alright.I think you should just move one..So let's take-.No water!.Got a sandbag-.Yay!.Oo! Nice call!.Now I guess I'll be collecting these!.And now we are at number two. So two of these-.Whispering Garden-.Um-.Whispering Garden that's-.And Cliffs of Abandon..That's this one..Cliffs of Abandon-.That's this one..Right next to it..I can take care of those turns..Oh yeah.Hopefully..Ok, my turn?.Yes..Mmhmm!.Ok.Um.Where are you at?.You're blue..I'm on Fool's Landing..I mean-.I can-.move to shore something.but.besides that there's-.not put-.not like- not- no point in me doing anything..Seems like..What do you guys think?.Um.See I just don't like wasting turns is the problem is..Yeah.I would-.I!.would suggest moving here. That'd be one turn..Mmhmm.Cause we don't need to give the lion to anybody just (yet), right?.Shouldn't I move to- like, this one or this one?.Well-.So I can shore this-.Yeah.I'd move to either here or- I'd move here..Ah!.And then shore up both of these..He can't..Yeah..I can!.That'll be three turns..One to move-.and then one turn to shore this, one turn to shore that..You can go diagonal?.Well he can fly..I c- I can move to wherever..Well he can fly..Oh that's right! I'm so sorry..Yeah.Ok!.So ok cool. So-.And then, yep.Helicopter card and this-.Nice!.Then-.Phantom Rock is gone and then Gold Gate..Oh..Ok awesome..We're ok with that..Your turn..Ok.Wait don't you have to do-.So I'm-.Oh you already did them I'm sorry nevermind..Yeah.Yeah.I wanna move here and give you-.this (right?).Yeah..No you-.Thank you..Oh..So I have four cards..Right..Just out of curiosity why'd you move there?.So I could give her-.Oh!.Cause- yeah..I have to be- I have to be on the same spot as her..Ok..And then I guess I should-.Head towards-.Fool's Landing? Cause you're really not doing anything..Yeah..Because if y-.I think you should move to my spot..I could move here and then shore up-.Yeah..that..No that'd be- That'd be more than three..Oh right. Ok..I think you should just move to my spot-.One, two-.And then on the next turn-.Yeah..if you wanna start collecting something I can just give you that..Yeah.So..Ok..Ok. Yeah we'll see what I draw..Yeah..Nice..Wait, you have six cards!.Oh that's your- ok I'm sorry..Oh this is my um-.I'll moce that out of the way so it's less confusing..Temple of the Moon.Ok.The other one is Iron Gate.And Iron Gate.Just over there.Ok.Are we done?.Yeah! Your turn..My turn..Yeah. Your turn..Yeah..Ok..So.One.Two.I think you're gonna wanna get your way over and get to here (or here)..Mmhmm.Well actually I was gonna-.Oh you're gonna give me the fire?.Yeah..Yeah we can both give you fires..Oh! Ok. Yay!.The next time around.So-.The only think we really need to-.I would-.Well, hmm..I would just make your way towards this because-.Ok..Maybe shore up a card if we want..Yeah. This is gonna- So-.(Thanks.) So if I go here-.That's one..That's one-.Flip both of these-.That's two-.That's two..That-.Oh right..and then go over-.here-.Oh wait, wait, wait, wait..That's three..Yeah..There're three..Wait..Wait. Back up..It was like that, right?.Mmhmm..Uh huh..Mmhmm..Because to pass cards I have to be with you guys so I actually have to get over there..Right..Ok..So- And we don't care about the (out) ones..So, this would be one turn, correct?.Yeah, just shore that-.One-.and then just move to-.Two-.and-.(nobody --).Might as well just hold on to that..Yeah. I think so..Um.But I really have nothing else to do, right?.Yeah..Right..So I'm gonna give it to you just so somebody's collecting these if we need to..Ok..Just if..Ok.Ok!.So one, two, three-.Whoops. Two treasure cards-.(--) You're doing the lions?.Yeah..that water thingy?.Ah! I hate the water thingy!.So now we're up to three..We have to shuffle these, right?.Mmhmm..Mmhmm..Mmhmm..Good bye Iron Gate, good bye Lost Lagoon!.Three?.Good bye Lost Lagoon!.Good bye Iron Gate!.Whispering Garden.You called it..That goes back in there..Oh..That's right..Ooo that means- What were the other ones that were being flipped?.Breaker's Bridge was flipped-.What else was flipped?.This one-.Ok..Just have to keep track of everything..Your turn..Ok. Um-.I'm eventually gonna need to-.be here right so I might as well just move there-.shore this up while I'm at it..I'd-.Ehh.I'd probably stay- I'd just shore it up..Just wait?.Ok..Cause somebody's gonna have to come to you to pass you that last one..Yeah..Good point. So that's one-.Ok..So that's one-.Is there anything else?.You could pass me-.You could just- you-.Do you want me to pass this to you?.Yeah. Because I'll- I'm gonna give him this next turn so I'll have room..Oh that's right..One, two- well you already have five cards..No you already have five cards..Oh I'd already have to get rid of something you're right..Oh poof!.No that's fine!.Well I could-.cause lion-.cuppy.I could always move people with these so like if she-.We don't wanna move right now though..There's no place to move..Yeah sure.So I'll just-.Nevermind..Yeah..leave it be..So this is two-.Um-.Ooo!.Should I keep the treasure card?.Or- and get rid of the sand bag or-? Ok..Oh definitely..You good with that?.Yeah I mean I agree..Yeah..Or just get rid of the- Honestly just get rid of the cup..Oh yeah.Wait what- ok..Cause we're not gonna u- We're not use it. Because you've got fire, I've got these, and she has those..One, two-.Oh! Yeah!.Mm.And then I'd use a sandbag to shore this one up just in case..Ok..Oh my god I didn't realize that was flipped. Yeah..So let me uh-.Cause you know it's gonna come. It's-.do that, get rid of-.it's has to play..that-.Yeah..Ok..If you would happen to-.(--) any of us really..And then I can't play these until my next turn, right?.Yeah cause your turn's technically over..Yeah..So Temple of the Moon again-.Uh, Cliffs of Abandon-.which you guys are all on.And Breaker's Bridge which is-.Right there. Just flipped it..Perfect- Beautiful..Ooo!.Is it worth-.Using a sand bag to flip a-.Temple of the Moon?.Well wait what do you need to do? Cause it's your turn now, right?.I'm gonna give him this-.That's one..Um-.Probably shore up where we are..Where- yeah shore that. That'll be my second turn-.That's two-.And-.I probably won't-.You could give her fire..Oh yeah, yeah. Good call, good call..Oh yeah! There you go..Cool.But that's what I'm saying. So should the sand-.Oh nevermind, nevermind..Wait is this the-.Just to protect this one.Was this shored up?.Oh god yeah..Yeah well we shored it up and then we just got it again, right?.Mmhmm..No but wasn't that one of my turns?.Cause I gave you one, and I gave her one, so what- What was my third turn?.Right..Shoring up the spot we were on..Oh the spot we were on ok..That's right..Yeah..Yeah so would it be worth- Cause I'm about to-.pick cards- So would it be worth her using the sand bag-.Yeah..Yeah..Definitely..Just to be safe..Yeah..Absolutely..Ok, cool..Ooo!.Alright so these are yours-.Which doesn't matter cause everything's safe, right? Oh no Bre-.Ok-.Copper Gate-.This one.Crimson Forest-.Wait..Oh that's- Ok yeah..Howling Garden..Here..Ok..Ok..Alright, my turn?.Uh huh..Mmhmm..Mmhmm..So I'll give this to you-.Yay.So that's one.And-.I'll shore this up.Yay.And then shore him up.And shore him up..Cause there's nothing else for you to really do, right?.Right..Oh wait, no! You need to move to- Oh the lion is there..I wanna stay where I'm at though so you can pass me that..Yes, yes..So yeah, those are my three..Ok..Water rise..I gotta get to the fire..Oh (--).I have to shuffle and put them back on top..(--).Three, huh?.Yep..Would you like to pick your three?.I'll take these three..And these go here..Mmhmm..Whisper Garden.Why's that keep doing that?.Howling Garden's gone.Howling Garden.Crimson Forest.Crimson Forest is gone..That's ok.So it's my turn now, correct?.Yeah.So we're definitely doing this..That's one..You should um-.Definitely flip that-.Yeah.Cause the last one-.That's two-.Oh!

I think- I think that's it.Yep.Does this (as) set up as the same as last time?.One, two-.No it's a little different.No, It's a little different.Is it?.Ok.I at first I did think it was.Yeah.Yeah cause I gotta head towards the fire.

So (are) we gonna pass the cards-.I didn't even realize.that way!.We could.We could.Yeah we could do that.I never thought of that!.Depending.Do you want to-.I'd say-.I'm sorry go ahead.I was just gonna say just hang out there for now.Yeah.Well you took one turn right?.But-.Yeah she has taken one turn.Yeah.Mmhmm.Just consider this.but you collect the lions, you collect the cuppys, and I'll give you the cuppy and you give that to her.Just so we- We have-.So.So.Wait.Who's gonna collect-.you're gonna give that-.(--).So you wanna give-.him to me?.Correct?.She should give-.this to him.No he's close so she's gonna collect those.Oh that's right! I give you the cuppy! Oh wait-.Yeah well we're both r- we're-.Mmhmm.I was thinking like in terms-.I'm sorry.Wait you can't do that now but-.Yeah.You gotta give him the cuppy, cause you're gonna collects the cups. She's gonna collect these cause she's near it.Yeah.Ok.You're gonna collect these because that's what you have.Yeah.I mean I'm right here too-.Oh that's true you can-.If we think- I was thinking like-.And your lion's right there!.I just wouldn't-.I was thinking like in terms of turns-.Mmhmm.If-.if-.you give hime this-.Mmhmm.No. She's collecting those.Actually I did forget that you can move diagonally.Cause I can just move someone whenever.Because if- If he collects these-.and then he gives me this-.Uh huh.And then you give that- I mean I guess it doesn't matter now because none of us will have four yet.Oh yeah! It's- We're basically saying the same thing. It's- It's who's gonna collect cups and who's gonna collect this.So, it's-.Yeah.Yeah.I'd say for now just don't pass anything.Ok.Uh.Because we all- We all have one- I mean other than give you all the fires.I wouldn't-.Cause everybody else has one-.Well I know that but I- We need to start at a point sometime so instead of waiting-.and wasting a turn.I'd say as soon as somebody gets two-.then start passing to them.Ok.But if we pass to you then you have two!.You know what you're saving.Yeah but like if she passes to me and then draws another one right now.Mm It's up to you, it's up to you! Do whatever you wanna do!.I guess she can always give it to me. I don't know.For you passing's not a big deal so-.Oh that's right!.Yeah.Ok.I guess you can-.Um.No, no, no!.I think you shouldn't-.give anyone anything right now. Cause you can do it whenever.Yeah, yeah.Ok.When it comes to our turns we'll- we'll work on giving something to someone. Yeah.You're right. You're right.Thank you for pointing that out.Ok.So I think your turn should just stop.See I think I know everything but I don't.Alright.I think you should just move one.So let's take-.No water!.Got a sandbag-.Yay!.Oo! Nice call!.Now I guess I'll be collecting these!.And now we are at number two. So two of these-.Whispering Garden-.Um-.Whispering Garden that's-.And Cliffs of Abandon.That's this one.Cliffs of Abandon-.That's this one.Right next to it.I can take care of those turns.Oh yeah.Hopefully.Ok, my turn?.Yes.Mmhmm!.Ok.Um.Where are you at?.You're blue.I'm on Fool's Landing.I mean-.I can-.move to shore something.but.besides that there's-.not put-.not like- not- no point in me doing anything.Seems like.What do you guys think?.Um.See I just don't like wasting turns is the problem is.Yeah.I would-.I!.would suggest moving here. That'd be one turn.Mmhmm.Cause we don't need to give the lion to anybody just (yet), right?.Shouldn't I move to- like, this one or this one?.Well-.So I can shore this-.Yeah.I'd move to either here or- I'd move here.Ah!.And then shore up both of these.He can't.Yeah.I can!.That'll be three turns.One to move-.and then one turn to shore this, one turn to shore that.You can go diagonal?.Well he can fly.I c- I can move to wherever.Well he can fly.Oh that's right! I'm so sorry.Yeah.Ok!.So ok cool. So-.And then, yep.Helicopter card and this-.Nice!.Then-.Phantom Rock is gone and then Gold Gate.Oh.Ok awesome.We're ok with that.Your turn.Ok.Wait don't you have to do-.So I'm-.Oh you already did them I'm sorry nevermind.Yeah.Yeah.I wanna move here and give you-.this (right?).Yeah.No you-.Thank you.Oh.So I have four cards.Right.Just out of curiosity why'd you move there?.So I could give her-.Oh!.Cause- yeah.I have to be- I have to be on the same spot as her.Ok.And then I guess I should-.Head towards-.Fool's Landing? Cause you're really not doing anything.Yeah.Because if y-.I think you should move to my spot.I could move here and then shore up-.Yeah.that.No that'd be- That'd be more than three.Oh right. Ok.I think you should just move to my spot-.One, two-.And then on the next turn-.Yeah.if you wanna start collecting something I can just give you that.Yeah.So.Ok.Ok. Yeah we'll see what I draw.Yeah.Nice.Wait, you have six cards!.Oh that's your- ok I'm sorry.Oh this is my um-.I'll moce that out of the way so it's less confusing.Temple of the Moon.Ok.The other one is Iron Gate.And Iron Gate.Just over there.Ok.Are we done?.Yeah! Your turn.My turn.Yeah. Your turn.Yeah.Ok.So.One.Two.I think you're gonna wanna get your way over and get to here (or here).Mmhmm.Well actually I was gonna-.Oh you're gonna give me the fire?.Yeah.Yeah we can both give you fires.Oh! Ok. Yay!.The next time around.So-.The only think we really need to-.I would-.Well, hmm.I would just make your way towards this because-.Ok.Maybe shore up a card if we want.Yeah. This is gonna- So-.(Thanks.) So if I go here-.That's one.That's one-.Flip both of these-.That's two-.That's two.That-.Oh right.and then go over-.here-.Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.That's three.Yeah.There're three.Wait.Wait. Back up.It was like that, right?.Mmhmm.Uh huh.Mmhmm.Because to pass cards I have to be with you guys so I actually have to get over there.Right.Ok.So- And we don't care about the (out) ones.So, this would be one turn, correct?.Yeah, just shore that-.One-.and then just move to-.Two-.and-.(nobody --).Might as well just hold on to that.Yeah. I think so.Um.But I really have nothing else to do, right?.Yeah.Right.So I'm gonna give it to you just so somebody's collecting these if we need to.Ok.Just if.Ok.Ok!.So one, two, three-.Whoops. Two treasure cards-.(--) You're doing the lions?.Yeah.that water thingy?.Ah! I hate the water thingy!.So now we're up to three.We have to shuffle these, right?.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Good bye Iron Gate, good bye Lost Lagoon!.Three?.Good bye Lost Lagoon!.Good bye Iron Gate!.Whispering Garden.You called it.That goes back in there.Oh.That's right.Ooo that means- What were the other ones that were being flipped?.Breaker's Bridge was flipped-.What else was flipped?.This one-.Ok.Just have to keep track of everything.Your turn.Ok. Um-.I'm eventually gonna need to-.be here right so I might as well just move there-.shore this up while I'm at it.I'd-.Ehh.I'd probably stay- I'd just shore it up.Just wait?.Ok.Cause somebody's gonna have to come to you to pass you that last one.Yeah.Good point. So that's one-.Ok.So that's one-.Is there anything else?.You could pass me-.You could just- you-.Do you want me to pass this to you?.Yeah. Because I'll- I'm gonna give him this next turn so I'll have room.Oh that's right.One, two- well you already have five cards.No you already have five cards.Oh I'd already have to get rid of something you're right.Oh poof!.No that's fine!.Well I could-.cause lion-.cuppy.I could always move people with these so like if she-.We don't wanna move right now though.There's no place to move.Yeah sure.So I'll just-.Nevermind.Yeah.leave it be.So this is two-.Um-.Ooo!.Should I keep the treasure card?.Or- and get rid of the sand bag or-? Ok.Oh definitely.You good with that?.Yeah I mean I agree.Yeah.Or just get rid of the- Honestly just get rid of the cup.Oh yeah.Wait what- ok.Cause we're not gonna u- We're not use it. Because you've got fire, I've got these, and she has those.One, two-.Oh! Yeah!.Mm.And then I'd use a sandbag to shore this one up just in case.Ok.Oh my god I didn't realize that was flipped. Yeah.So let me uh-.Cause you know it's gonna come. It's-.do that, get rid of-.it's has to play.that-.Yeah.Ok.If you would happen to-.(--) any of us really.And then I can't play these until my next turn, right?.Yeah cause your turn's technically over.Yeah.So Temple of the Moon again-.Uh, Cliffs of Abandon-.which you guys are all on.And Breaker's Bridge which is-.Right there. Just flipped it.Perfect- Beautiful.Ooo!.Is it worth-.Using a sand bag to flip a-.Temple of the Moon?.Well wait what do you need to do? Cause it's your turn now, right?.I'm gonna give him this-.That's one.Um-.Probably shore up where we are.Where- yeah shore that. That'll be my second turn-.That's two-.And-.I probably won't-.You could give her fire.Oh yeah, yeah. Good call, good call.Oh yeah! There you go.Cool.But that's what I'm saying. So should the sand-.Oh nevermind, nevermind.Wait is this the-.Just to protect this one.Was this shored up?.Oh god yeah.Yeah well we shored it up and then we just got it again, right?.Mmhmm.No but wasn't that one of my turns?.Cause I gave you one, and I gave her one, so what- What was my third turn?.Right.Shoring up the spot we were on.Oh the spot we were on ok.That's right.Yeah.Yeah so would it be worth- Cause I'm about to-.pick cards- So would it be worth her using the sand bag-.Yeah.Yeah.Definitely.Just to be safe.Yeah.Absolutely.Ok, cool.Ooo!.Alright so these are yours-.Which doesn't matter cause everything's safe, right? Oh no Bre-.Ok-.Copper Gate-.This one.Crimson Forest-.Wait.Oh that's- Ok yeah.Howling Garden.Here.Ok.Ok.Alright, my turn?.Uh huh.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.So I'll give this to you-.Yay.So that's one.And-.I'll shore this up.Yay.And then shore him up.And shore him up.Cause there's nothing else for you to really do, right?.Right.Oh wait, no! You need to move to- Oh the lion is there.I wanna stay where I'm at though so you can pass me that.Yes, yes.So yeah, those are my three.Ok.Water rise.I gotta get to the fire.Oh (--).I have to shuffle and put them back on top.(--).Three, huh?.Yep.Would you like to pick your three?.I'll take these three.And these go here.Mmhmm.Whisper Garden.Why's that keep doing that?.Howling Garden's gone.Howling Garden.Crimson Forest.Crimson Forest is gone.That's ok.So it's my turn now, correct?.Yeah.So we're definitely doing this.That's one.You should um-.Definitely flip that-.Yeah.Cause the last one-.That's two-.Oh! And then gr- Get this!.Oh wait I have to be on it.I c- I can- I can move you.Yeah.Move me!.Yeah.Bing!.And now your third turn will be to take it.Yay!.Who's the man?.Woo!.Nice.And I took my three turns, correct?.Uh yeah. So-.So now I need two of him.Helicopter! Lion!.Ok.Awesome.And then.So.I have to take two, right?.Oh that's right.Three.Yeah, three.Three.Actually.Oops.Sorry.The Temple of the Moon-.That's ok you can flip- You can still get that, right?.Mmhmm.Breaker's Bridge, which of course we know, and the Gates.the Copper.And those go there.Ok.Ok.So one move to get here.Two to do that.Two moves to collect the treasure.And then third move maybe move back. Yeah.Yeah cause this doesn't matter if it goes now.Exactly.Beautiful.I like this game!.No!.Sorry.Two chalices.Ok.And then.Three of these-.Do- Are we set up for-.He's about to go to the lions.And then we need one more.And then-.Alright so-.No.We have three.Oh we do have three?.Who's the man?.Silver Gate.Uh, here.We don't care.Ah!.Cave of Embers, here.Don't care-.Cliffs of Abandon, which you guys are one-.That we need to take care of.Alright.My turn?.Mmhmm.Um.I can just shore this up.Definitely.Um.I can just go to Fool's Landing.Yeah cause we really don't care about-.These anymore.Yeah.No.I can-.if I use this, I can just get someone else.You can-.to Fool's Landing.You can take me.Mmhmm.I'm done.My- my- my role in the game is over.Ok.You're- which one are you?

Cause your turn's coming up any way.Yeah.Right, right, right, right, right.Yeah.It's a good thing we're allowed to backtrack!.Yeah.(--)- Was that three moves?.Uh, well that was actually really still just-.Oh.Oh we didn't even do your-.One- Two. That was two.Because this (--) doesn't count as a turn.Ok and then you need one more move.Yeah.I mean.Um.Um no one needs to pass any card to anybody, right?.If you want.Yeah. I think we're good just kinda like, leaving it.Yeah?.Ok.Cards-.You're up.No we gotta-.Oh yeah. I totally forgot that.Ok so I only have five-.Mm that doesn't matter cause we're not worried about this-.Yep.Bronze Gate.Here.Coral Palace.Here.Dunes of Deception.And here.Your turn.Ok.So one-.Two-.two-.Can I play this any time?.Yeah.You should save it-.until we all-.I was gonna fly him over.Oh.Actually-.But we still need one of those to win.Oh!.Yeah.Yeah.So-.I can just do three to here.Cause I can move diagonally.That's right!.Mmhmm.And then-.Yeah.Wait!.Oh yeah take those too.Wait, wait.Wait we should probably like shore something.Wait!.Cause I-.What if he got- What if you get a water rise card?.Wait I have a question.No, no if- Ok so say he moves there, and that we lose this-.But she can-.She can use these-.Can't he swim?.Yeah.He-.Yeah s-.Yeah.Can you swim to Fool's Landing?.Yeah he could.So yeah!

She's the Messenger..Right.Oh, that's true.So, maybe just go-.Move here, sh-.He does- you don't even have- you can shore up diagonally so you don't even have to move.Yeah, oh yeah, so shore up.Shore up Cliffs of Abandon.Um, yeah- so this is definitely getting shored up.And then-.But the- oh, you might as well move there.Well-.Mm.But, everybody else who ha- might have cards is further away so I don't-.Maybe just go to Misty Marsh?.I'll- I'll just go over the Cliffs of Abandon anyway and-.Ok.That way I'm closer to everyone.Alright.You're right in the middle.Yeah.Yeah.Oh thank you.Mmhmm.Well there's enough fire-.Crystals in play that we could.Get that done.I don't know how-.Mmhmm.Yeah.We're going to have to discard and just- I'd say just discard these then.(--).Oh, I don't have to discard anything yet.No, I mean when she gives you-.Yeah.Eventually.Yeah.And-.Iron Gate.And-.Temple of the Moon.Um.So, I could give both mine.To you- you.Mm.That's not-.That's not a bad idea.Because then-.Mmhmm.Yeah.If she has a (--) one, she can give it to you.Without-.And then you can just-.Mmhmm.Then you can just fly there.Off of-.Yeah.So you have to move to me.Correct.Correct.So, one-.And then-.(--).One, two, three.Two, three.Two-.And you have to discard one.Mm.(I don't know).Yeah.Well, eh-.Yeah.Yeah, that's ok.I'm the bad guy here.That goes there.Move that up.Do we want to use her sandbags on this?.Where's the other one?.Mm.Um-.I don't think we need to.There both kind of out of the way, though.Is my only concern, I guess.(--).Do we have anything close to it?.(Wait)-.You can go diagonal.Uh-.I mean-.May as well?.I don't- I don't know- unless we have an- we only have one sandbag.Or, I mean we only have one sandbag and we might need it later.(Right, we might need it later)- I think is-.So, three.Mmhmm.Breaker's Bridge.Lost Lagoon.Eh-.And-.Cliffs of Abandon.Ok.So- should I give this to him?.And then- should I move?.Wait, no you have to discard one.I mean-.Get rid of the-.Do I discard as soon I have more than five or when it's- ok..Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Oh, uh, what are (we gonna) (--).(--) yeah, this one.That's what we're getting rid of right now.Wait-.Yeah.Yeah.'Cause I need to give this to him.Yeah, 'cause you can give-.And then-.So that was-.One.Mmhmm.Do I wanna move here?.Probably not.Shore up.Shore things up, yeah.Shore-.Shore this up?.Since that's where-.(--).Mmhmm.Two-.And that one?.Uh.You can't this diagonal.You can-.Oh yeah.No, she's not diagonal.

Well no, I have to use this now.Not.That's- that's discarded, yeah.aYeah.Oh, right.I can just move you down there.I kind of-.aYeah, I think moving-.Down would be smart because-.To get there would take him more than-.It would take your three which means you'd have to wait another turn.That's right.Mm.Yeah.Ok.Chillin'.Alright, and now-.Is that right?.Wait no, we just did-.You're up.Right?.No, we didn't do that.No.But did I draw my cards yet?.Well, no. It's my turn.Yeah, you drew cards.Yeah.aYou did your thing.Oh, yeah. You're done, yeah.'Cause he gave you the fire.Right.Alright.Oh yeah.Oh.Ok.So now, I technically on- still have like two moves left but I- there's nothing else that I really-.Can or need to do. So I think I'm just gonna hang out.(Right).So I get two card.You can't shore up anybody.Nnmm.And you get rid of one.Oh- good..Mm.Yeah.Um, you already have fire so we don't need fire.We don't have to discard it anyway, 'cause this doesn't-.Yeah, to get rid- (--)- water.(I draw)-.Oh that's true.Go ahead.(Go ahead).So you're just (at) that.I'll shuffles this. This can go over here.Mmhmm.Do you want to play another sandbags, though?.Mm.(--) choose three.Maybe howling.I'd- I'd- I'd-.Yeah, maybe save Howling Gardens immediately.Yeah, yes. Definitely.Yeah.And then-.It'll be three of those- oh it's on (--).(--).But yeah, put the-.Ok, I'd go- nope! That was Whispering Garden what we ended up with so-.Ah.Uh Copper Gate is gone.Alright.That's neat.And, uh, Cliff's of Abandon?.Yeah, Cliffs of (--).Cliffs of Abandon.That's actually good.'Cause now I can-.Shore up both those.Uh.Uh, shore up.So you have to move to Whispering Garden first.Mmhmm.I can do-.Mm.That will be within range of (--).One.That's one.Then two would be both of them.And then, does anyone need anything?.Um.What if we-.I mean, you can't- you can't-.I-.(Well) just for the heck of it I could just-.You can give her the-.Give- give her the cup..To-.Yeah.Yeah, just-.Might as well.She might be able to-.Yeah.Send it somewhere.Mm 'kay.(More in the center so-).'Kay, so-.I mean-.And then- card.Two of those.Mm.Oh good.Nice.Very nice.The three-.Uh.Lost Lagoon.Uh, Breaker's Bridge.And Crimson Forest.Is gone now.Ok.So do I wanna shore this up?.First-.You wanna send the-.Earth crystal to me.Oh yeah, that's right.One-.Thank you.Then you wanna discard fire.Uh, yes I do!.Then don't you get-.No, on your turn.Uh.And then shore this up.That sounds like a good idea to me, yeah.Yeah, I like that too.Let's do-.Uh.I don't think it's really to your advantage to move.Anywhere, just yet.Ok.Unless anybody sees anything I don't.No, 'cause I mean she may as well be on a space with someone else.Yeah.Right.Ok.Oh boy! Look at that.That was really nice.Wow.That's wonderful.(So now clearly)-.We're in the money.Don't (--).Silver Gate.(--).Salt gate?.Silver.Silver Gate.Silver Gate! Sure, sure.Cave of Embers.Howling Garden.Those are-.Alright.Alright, so-.So, my turn.I have a helicopter as well as-.So I can-.As you.We have our three-.I can fly here, get this-.And shore it up.And shore it up..Yeah.But, wait. Do we need to shore it up?.We don't need to, but, just to prevent-.S-.Us from losing too many tiles-.Yeah.Like I would rather shore this one up but there's no way I can-.Get this and shore that up..What about-.Mmhmm.Yeah.Plus, I- I-.You wanna increase your chances-.Beca- just because of the cards have it's more important to have the-.Wait, you're there-.(How)-.Blue one.And you have four, four and four.One, two-.Three.Mmhmm.(--).So save- I would save the cave.Yeah. Shore- shore it up just to-.Just to do it.Yeah.Yeah, I agree.So go here-.Yeah.So that's-.Shore that up.Two.And-.And-.And then three.I like (that).(Ta-ting).(So-).Nice.Alright.And now three.Ok.Right.Right, (--) three more.I've good (--) first.Oh.There you go that's (--) I'm getting ahead of myself. My bad.I'm (stuck).Bronze Gate.Oh, we have so much time.Mmhmm.Coral Palace.And, uh, Dunes od Deception.'Kay.Ok.So-.Obviously, first things firtst, sh-.Get rid of those.Got that.(What's going on?).Now-.What can I do that's most helpful right now?.Go back to-.Fool's Landing.You have two actions.I have two actions. Now I could-.Do you wanna-.I might-.It might be-.Best to repair this 'cause you need to go there.Sh-.Sure.Yeah.Mmhmm.Shore that up.Ok, so-.But-.You have a helicopter.Right.I have a helicopter as well.And-.Well this- this is the closest one for her to get to.And, if I don't shore it up, it could-.Be-.Gone.Mmhmm.Very soon so-.Ok.On-.Or, we could use her sandb- you could go to Fool's Landing, she could play her sandbag on that-.You could fly both of them to Fool's Landing.(--).And-.Er no, he could fly-.Himself to Fool's-.Yeah, no both, 'cause we're both on the same tile.Mmhmm.Yeah, but she's gonna- she has to come here to do this.He has to got there.Oh yeah.Mm.But she can go one-.I could- I could go there.I can go there.Mmhmm.Yeah.Next turn.Mmhmm.I was just trying to see if we could win, like, as quickly as-.But I don't know if there's.Yeah, that- no that's- that's a very good idea, I think.It might be better to just play it safe and-.We have to wait for-.Your turn anyways.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.So-.So-.I could go.One, two-.So we may as well save the sandbag and you fix it.Yeah, fix it.Ok.Yeah.There we go.Ok.That's it.(Right).Oh, no. That's not it. I keep on forgetting about the-.All three of those-.Yeah, the water. That's not the most important-.Part of the whole game, or anything.Misty Marsh-.And the Tidal Palace and the Temple of the Sun, which I just left-.Falling into the ocean.Nice that it picked all of the ones on the outside.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Convenient.Ok.So-.I mean the smart thing, to me, is to go here-.'Cause then we can both helicopter lift-.To-.Fool's Landing, is that correct?.Yeah.I think so.But don't I have to-.S- lay on there to get this?.Right, so-.Well on your turn, yeah.Oh- oh, oh. Gotcha.Yeah, on your turn you'll get there so-.On your turn, you'll move over and then-.So, I guess, like, you could-.Then, no wait- how are we getting you there?.(--) for your turn.Oh, I just go diagonal.Yeah, but we have to wait now.(There)-.So-.Alright, so he-.Oh, I see what you mean.We have to wait for your turn-.So on your turn-.Your turn now, you move-.Here-.Mmhmm.Right.That's two.That's two..She, on her turn, moves here and gets this-.Right.Um, on my turn I go to Fool's Landing-.On his turn he goes to Fool's Landing-.You can play your helicopter lift then-.To move-.To get-.You two here-.Right.And then yo play yours, yeah.And I can play to win.So that's- sounds good to me.In addition, you have one move left over right now, so just shore up anything. It doesn't really matter at this point.Right, so I might as well-.Right, so I'll shore up these two.The gates, yeah.Sure.Fix the doors.(--).(One).One, two-.Yeah.Oh, now we have another helicopter-.Mm.(Good).More water.So that goes tehre.And these ones should shuffle up.We can actually win faster.Mm.(--).Mmhmm.Wait, can (we) play cards now before I draw anything?.Well she has to take her turn but-.Yeah, she has to do all that.She still has to get the chalice.Yeah, so, (the)-.Yeah, so just-.Oh yeah, it doesn't matter.Yeah.Flood-.So, the Temple of the Sun-.Goodbye.The Coral Palace.Mm.Mmhmm.And, Bronze Gate.Which is-.Right there, yeah.(--).Ok.Alright.So then I-.So yeah, so move th- take a turn and then-.Uh collect the-.So do I shore-.S-.Do I just move or can I sh-.Move- yeah, just move down there-.That's two.So that's two.Yeah.And then cash in those-.Three will be ca- yeah.(That)-.'Kay.I'll take-.And then- we can win. Right now..Wait-.But-.Yeah, we (can win) right now.Yeah.So I can fly us to-.Or no, wait. We can't win right now.Why not?.Why?.'Cause we need- on my turn-.I have two.He has two, so you move them-.And him, and then on my turn we would win.Oh, no.No, I can't move him 'cause I'm not on the same space.You don't have to, for the helicopter lift.You can use it on anyone.No, I have to be-.I have to be-.You don't have to be.No, so the way the helicopter lift works-.Lift your team to Fool's Landing for the win-.Move one or more pawns on the same tile, so it just-.The paw- you would have to play both of them-.Right.If you played both helicopter lift cards, then you could move- you use one to move him-.(Why) does he go there?.And then the other one to move you two.Mmhmm.Mm so-.Yeah.So that-.And then we'd have to wait for your turn to be over-.Which is right now anyways.Which is right now.Well I didn't draw my- does it matter that I didn't draw my two and then-.Well, yeah.Uh.You'd have to do that but that's gonna just- yeah, just do it.Right.Now we're (good).Ok.(--).Ok.Good.Now-.And then my three-.Which doesn't matter.Then flood some things, which are-.Ok.Breaker's Bridge-.Lost Lagoon.Gone.And Cave of Embers.It was there.Ok, and now it's my turn.Yeah, you fly there.So I'll just go here-.So fly there, play that-.(I won).Boom.(Wait).Good work.Beat our time.Did we?.On the first game, yeah.Oh.What was the first one?.I think it was twelve minutes left on the first one.Yeah, it was tw-.Oh.Nice",s,%  sv  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  %  sd  %  %  %  %  %  qy  sd  sd  b  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  ba  %  sd  fc  b  sv  b  b  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  sv  b  sd  b  b  sv  qo  b  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  %  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  b  sd  %  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  b  %  %  sd  sd  sd  qw  sv  aa  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  %  b  qy^d  %  sd  b  %  %  b  sd  b  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sv  %  b  sd  ad  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  b  ft  b  sd  sd  ad  sd  b  b  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  %  sd  %  sd  fc  b  %  sv  %  b  b  sd  %  sd  b  sd  %  b  sd  aa  aa  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  h  b  %  b  aa  sd  sd  ad  sd  qw  b  %  sv  sd  sd  %  qy  %  sd  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  nn  %  sd  b  qy  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  b  qw  sd  sd  %  b  b  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  aa  sd  sd  b  ad  sd  %  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  aa  sd  aa  br  sd  sd  ba  %  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  aa  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  ba  b  sd  sd  b  aa  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  fc  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  qh  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sv  %  sd  nn  sd  %  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  aa  %  b  b  sd  sd  bh  sd  sd  b  sd  nn  sd  sd  sd  b  qw  ba  sd  b  b  b  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  sd  ba  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  aa  ad  ad  sv  sd  b  qy  b  sd  sd  sd  qy  aa  b  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  %  sv  %  sd  sd  sd  %  b  b  sd  sd  b  ad  b  sd  b  %  sd  sd  b  ba  ba  ba  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  fc  sd  sd  sv  nn  %  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  b  ba  sv  ba  ba  sv  sd  %  b  %  sd  b^m  b  b  sd  b^m  %  b  b  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  %  sd  b  sd  sd  qo  b  b  %  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  b  aa  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  %  %  sd  sd  b  %  ba  b  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  aa  sd  %  b  b  b  sd  %  %  sd  b  sd  %  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  sv  %  %  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  sd  b  b  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sv  b  b  sd  b  aa  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sv  b  %  sd  sd  %  qy  b  aa  sd  sd  b  sv  b  sv  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  %  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  qy  b  sd  %  %  sd  b  sd  %  ba  sd  sd  sv  sv  b  %  b  qy  sd  sd  sd  %  %  aa  b  sd  sd  fc  sd  b  b  sd  %  aa  %  b  b  %  sd  sd  %  %  sd  ad  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  b  sd  sd  b  %  sv  b  sd  sv  qo  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  %  sd  %  %  qy  aa  %  sv  b  sd  b  %  b  ba  %  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  b  ba  sd  qy  sd  b  qw  sd  sd  b  ba,"So-.Just start shoring up places, I guess.Sounds good.(I'ts) just like last time.(There), so that's one trun.Two-.Three.I like it.Good.Nn.(The) forest.Uh, (--).(--).Uh.That there.(--).Did you move it up one?.It has to be moved up one.It's still two, right?.Yeah.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.So, Phantom Rock.Gone.And the Breaker's Bridge.It's over here.My turn?.Yep.Mm.Just move?.So like-.I guess you (could go) back to breaker- yeah.You can shore up Breaker's Bridge.Yeah, you can shore up Breaker's Bridge.

Well no, I have to use this now.Not.That's- that's discarded, yeah.aYeah.Oh, right.I can just move you down there.I kind of-.aYeah, I think moving-.Down would be smart because-.To get there would take him more than-.It would take your three which means you'd have to wait another turn.That's right.Mm.Yeah.Ok.Chillin'.Alright, and now-.Is that right?.Wait no, we just did-.You're up.Right?.No, we didn't do that.No.But did I draw my cards yet?.Well, no. It's my turn.Yeah, you drew cards.Yeah.aYou did your thing.Oh, yeah.

This can go over here.Mmhmm.Do you want to play another sandbags, though?.Mm.(--) choose three.Maybe howling.I'd- I'd- I'd-.Yeah, maybe save Howling Gardens immediately.Yeah, yes. Definitely.Yeah.And then-.It'll be three of those- oh it's on (--).(--).But yeah, put the-.Ok, I'd go- nope! That was Whispering Garden what we ended up with so-.Ah.Uh Copper Gate is gone.Alright.That's neat.And, uh, Cliff's of Abandon?.Yeah, Cliffs of (--).Cliffs of Abandon.That's actually good.'Cause now I can-.Shore up both those.Uh.Uh, shore up.So you have to move to Whispering Garden first.Mmhmm.I can do-.Mm.That will be within range of (--).One.That's one.Then two would be both of them.And then, does anyone need anything?.Um.What if we-.I mean, you can't- you can't-.I-.(Well) just for the heck of it I could just-.You can give her the-.Give- give her the cup.To-.Yeah.Yeah, just-.Might as well.She might be able to-.Yeah.Send it somewhere.Mm 'kay.(More in the center so-).'Kay, so-.I mean-.And then- card.Two of those.Mm.Oh good.Nice.Very nice.The three-.Uh.Lost Lagoon.Uh, Breaker's Bridge.And Crimson Forest.Is gone now.Ok.So do I wanna shore this up?.First-.You wanna send the-.Earth crystal to me.Oh yeah, that's right.One-.Thank you.Then you wanna discard fire.Uh, yes I do!.Then don't you get-.No, on your turn.Uh.And then shore this up.That sounds like a good idea to me, yeah.Yeah, I like that too.Let's do-.Uh.I don't think it's really to your advantage to move.Anywhere, just yet.Ok.Unless anybody sees anything I don't.No, 'cause I mean she may as well be on a space with someone else.Yeah.Right.Ok.Oh boy! Look at that.That was really nice.Wow.That's wonderful.(So now clearly)-.We're in the money.Don't (--).Silver Gate.(--).Salt gate?.Silver.Silver Gate.Silver Gate! Sure, sure.Cave of Embers.Howling Garden.Those are-.Alright.Alright, so-.So, my turn.I have a helicopter as well as-.So I can-.As you.We have our three-.I can fly here, get this-.And shore it up.And shore it up.Yeah.But, wait. Do we need to shore it up?.We don't need to, but, just to prevent-.S-.Us from losing too many tiles-.Yeah.Like I would rather shore this one up but there's no way I can-.Get this and shore that up.What about-.Mmhmm.Yeah.Plus, I- I-.You wanna increase your chances-.Beca- just because of the cards have it's more important to have the-.Wait, you're there-.(How)-.Blue one.And you have four, four and four.One, two-.Three.Mmhmm.(--).So save- I would save the cave.Yeah. Shore- shore it up just to-.Just to do it.Yeah.Yeah, I agree.So go here-.Yeah.So that's-.Shore that up.Two.And-.And-.And then three.I like (that).(Ta-ting).(So-).Nice.Alright.And now three.Ok.Right.Right, (--) three more.I've good (--) first.Oh.There you go that's (--) I'm getting ahead of myself. My bad.I'm (stuck).Bronze Gate.Oh, we have so much time.Mmhmm.Coral Palace.And, uh, Dunes od Deception.'Kay.Ok.So-.Obviously, first things firtst, sh-.Get rid of those.Got that.(What's going on?).Now-.What can I do that's most helpful right now?.Go back to-.Fool's Landing.You have two actions.I have two actions. Now I could-.Do you wanna-.I might-.It might be-.Best to repair this 'cause you need to go there.Sh-.Sure.Yeah.Mmhmm.Shore that up.Ok, so-.But-.You have a helicopter.Right.I have a helicopter as well.And-.Well this- this is the closest one for her to get to.And, if I don't shore it up, it could-.Be-.Gone.Mmhmm.Very soon so-.Ok.On-.Or, we could use her sandb- you could go to Fool's Landing, she could play her sandbag on that-.You could fly both of them to Fool's Landing.(--).And-.Er no, he could fly-.Himself to Fool's-.Yeah, no both, 'cause we're both on the same tile.Mmhmm.Yeah, but she's gonna- she has to come here to do this.He has to got there.Oh yeah.Mm.But she can go one-.I could- I could go there.I can go there.Mmhmm.Yeah.Next turn.Mmhmm.I was just trying to see if we could win, like, as quickly as-.But I don't know if there's.Yeah, that- no that's- that's a very good idea, I think.It might be better to just play it safe and-.We have to wait for-.Your turn anyways.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.So-.So-.I could go.One, two-.So we may as well save the sandbag and you fix it.Yeah, fix it.Ok.Yeah.There we go.Ok.That's it.(Right).Oh, no. That's not it. I keep on forgetting about the-.All three of those-.Yeah, the water. That's not the most important-.Part of the whole game, or anything.Misty Marsh-.And the Tidal Palace and the Temple of the Sun, which I just left-.Falling into the ocean.Nice that it picked all of the ones on the outside.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.Convenient.Ok.So-.I mean the smart thing, to me, is to go here-.'Cause then we can both helicopter lift-.To-.Fool's Landing, is that correct?.Yeah.I think so.But don't I have to-.S- lay on there to get this?.Right, so-.Well on your turn, yeah.Oh- oh, oh. Gotcha.Yeah, on your turn you'll get there so-.On your turn, you'll move over and then-.So, I guess, like, you could-.Then, no wait- how are we getting you there?.(--) for your turn.Oh, I just go diagonal.Yeah, but we have to wait now.(There)-.So-.Alright, so he-.Oh, I see what you mean.We have to wait for your turn-.So on your turn-.Your turn now, you move-.Here-.Mmhmm.Right.That's two.That's two.She, on her turn, moves here and gets this-.Right.Um, on my turn I go to Fool's Landing-.On his turn he goes to Fool's Landing-.You can play your helicopter lift then-.To move-.To get-.You two here-.Right.And then yo play yours, yeah.And I can play to win.So that's- sounds good to me.In addition, you have one move left over right now, so just shore up anything. It doesn't really matter at this point.Right, so I might as well-.Right, so I'll shore up these two.The gates, yeah.Sure.Fix the doors.(--).(One).One, two-.Yeah.Oh, now we have another helicopter-.Mm.(Good).More water.So that goes tehre.And these ones should shuffle up.We can actually win faster.Mm.(--).Mmhmm.Wait, can (we) play cards now before I draw anything?.Well she has to take her turn but-.Yeah, she has to do all that.She still has to get the chalice.Yeah, so, (the)-.Yeah, so just-.Oh yeah, it doesn't matter.Yeah.Flood-.So, the Temple of the Sun-.Goodbye.The Coral Palace.Mm.Mmhmm.And, Bronze Gate.Which is-.Right there, yeah.(--).Ok.Alright.So then I-.So yeah, so move th- take a turn and then-.Uh collect the-.So do I shore-.S-.Do I just move or can I sh-.Move- yeah, just move down there-.That's two.So that's two.Yeah.And then cash in those-.Three will be ca- yeah.(That)-.'Kay.I'll take-.And then- we can win. Right now.Wait-.But-.Yeah, we (can win) right now.Yeah.So I can fly us to-.Or no, wait. We can't win right now.Why not?.Why?.'Cause we need- on my turn-.I have two.He has two, so you move them-.And him, and then on my turn we would win.Oh, no.No, I can't move him 'cause I'm not on the same space.You don't have to, for the helicopter lift.You can use it on anyone.No, I have to be-.I have to be-.You don't have to be.No, so the way the helicopter lift works-.Lift your team to Fool's Landing for the win-.Move one or more pawns on the same tile, so it just-.The paw- you would have to play both of them-.Right.If you played both helicopter lift cards, then you could move- you use one to move him-.(Why) does he go there?.And then the other one to move you two.Mmhmm.Mm so-.Yeah.So that-.And then we'd have to wait for your turn to be over-.Which is right now anyways.Which is right now.Well I didn't draw my- does it matter that I didn't draw my two and then-.Well, yeah.Uh.You'd have to do that but that's gonna just- yeah, just do it.Right.Now we're (good).Ok.(--).Ok.Good.Now-.And then my three-.Which doesn't matter.Then flood some things, which are-.Ok.Breaker's Bridge-.Lost Lagoon.Gone.And Cave of Embers.It was there.Ok, and now it's my turn.Yeah, you fly there.So I'll just go here-.So fly there, play that-.(I won).Boom.(Wait).Good work.Beat our time.Did we?.On the first game, yeah.Oh.What was the first one?.I think it was twelve minutes left on the first one.Yeah, it was tw-.Oh.Nice %  sv  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  ba  %  sd  %  %  %  %  %  qy  sd  sd  b  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  ba  %  sd  fc

Team5001.csv,"Okay so it's my turn. Um, I have two chalices and I'm right here..So.I'm gonna.flip Lost Lagoon and Temple of the Moon.Wait wait. Oh..Uh, I think.just to like.there might be a way for you to flip all four cards..Like if you.take one move here.you can flip.these two cards and if you move there you can flip those two cards..Oh flip those two. Yeah that's a good call. Okay so.Or wait a minute. If you do this first, you can flip these two and then move here and flip those two and you'll be closer to that..Okay yeah.I like that move..Okay so I'm gonna move here, that's one..Actually wait no that, cause then I'd have to move down here and that'd be another move, yeah..If you flip it (right)--.Oh, true..That's that would be three moves..But then on your next move you can f--.Yeah that's true so I'm just gonna--.One.Two three..So that's two moves there..How is it, oh..Cause I had to move over one and then yeah.Move. Oh..One..Okay..then flip those and then I guess move down here..Those are my moves. Um then two treasure cards.a.Okay..Thank you. Alright water is rising card..(So I got a--).So Temple of the Moon.and Phantom Rock so.Temple of the Moon.Phantom Rocks is removed..Hm Phantom Rock. Alright so Phantom Rock's gone..Okay wow. Alright..Then waters rising goes back over there..And then.your turn.Okay..right? Yeah..So.I can flip this.for one move.Mhm..and.I can move here, flip this.and that will be my three moves..Yeah cause I also think it's important that we get you near the Cave of Shadows cause then I can give you that and hopefully you'll get a fire card.Alright..Okay..on the next turn so we can like start like moving towards getting the um.statues..So.move.and.shore up..Three moves.and I'm going to pull two cards..Not lion,.sandbags,.Alright so maybe we should--.Well I can move back there afterwards..Yeah..And now.pull two of these..Mhm..Got.Lost Lagoon and Cliff's--.Alright so Lost Lagoon is gone..City, Cliff's of Abandon..Oh..Okay..Here you go..That's cities. No that's cliffs..I don't know why I keep saying cities..Alright, cool..Alright..So um in my case I'm at Fool's Landing already..Um.Um.We've got, you've got two of the statues. You got two of the chalices..Yeah..Actually right now.Um.you could fly here and move then shore up..Flip it over yeah. I guess I could do that..Yeah..So.Cause also when you're down here you're right in the centralized location of all four statues.Right..Yeah..which is, and Fool's Landing. So like this is like the important little quadrant..(--).Yeah..Okay so this is one.and then.And.let's (--).you could.fly somewhere else but like I'm right here so I can flip that on the next move..Yeah I mean I think it's important that we all stay kind of like down here because like all four of the statues are down here and then Fool's Landing is right there too..Guess you could just move up one..Yeah..And that's.that's two and then (--)..Yeah and then just you can move one more yeah..Just move somewhere (on your way --)..Alright..Or you could've moved through there and flipped it over..Oh..Oh.okay..Oh well I mean yeah it's only Cliff's of Abandon. It doesn't really have any like big--.Okay..Things on it..Two and one two..Two..And I just flipped them for you..Two yeah..Breaker's Bridge and Gold Gate..(--) Breaker's Bridge..Your turn..Alright so.Okay..um I'll.Oh.if you're here, if you move here you can flip both of those in the next move.and so that would be two moves..So one.two.And.and then.move next to a chalice..Oh..Yeah so I'll just move.back down..Oh no where's the chalice thingy..Where'd--.There?.Oh.okay..Yeah it's closer than over here..Okay..As soon as we move down there that's three. Two treasure cards..Oh perfect..Got a chalice and this thing. Five cards..Okay..Um.Whispering Garden Iron Gate..Iron Gate. So Iron Gate and then Whispering Garden..Garden, yeah..Okay..Alright..And my turn..So.do we, should I save my sandbag?.I have two of these.and (--) is right here..Or actually right there..So I can move one two and flip well one two and flip.for my three moves.unless.yeah..You could do that or.what I think you should do is I think you should go.one.Two..two.three.and then.because--.Well I only have two right now so.That's true but if you, if we like stay down here there's the four statues, yeah so then like whenever anything like, yeah..We can get everything..So don't worry about that part of the board?.So whenever anything gets like sunk or like gets flooded, like one of us is always going to be around. Yeah exactly..We can save them here..One of us could jump in and that's right..Okay..And then Fool's Landing is right there too..Yeah, right..Wait should I give any of my cards to anybody?.At this point, no..I don't.I don't think so, no..I'll give you mine when it gets to that point..Yeah exactly so then I can just get the chalice on the next turn, yeah..Right..Okay so one.two.three.and that's my three actions..Okay..One two waters rise.and.chalice.so--.Well okay..Alright so.Move up the water level one..so now we have to shuffle..So three so.Gold Gate,.Well Gold Gate's gone..Iron Gate,.and Temple of the Moon..What does that even mean..Okay Gold Gate's gone and Iron Gate's gone..Okay..Yeah..Gold Gate and Iron Gate..Temp--.What do these little things on there mean?.I think that's um.that's just where we originate..Oh..Yeah..Okay..Okay so--.And now it's your turn..Okay..Yup..Alright so I'll give you mine..Oh wait..Oh you have to be on the same--.Oh that's right I have to go, that's right. You're right..Oh discard discard..Wait discard the waters rises yeah yeah yeah..Yeah yeah okay okay..Yeah, okay..Are you on the same one?.So I'm not uh so you're.you're here..Right there and you can fly there..So I can just go, I can just fly there, right?.Yeah so you just go, yup..Mhm..So one.So I can fly there if I, that didn't have to count as a move,.Yes it does. Well.does it?.Yeah cause that's your special power so that--.Oh..well.Unless--.you can either use this, which I think you might want to save for a little bit later cause right now you don't have any other cards..um.Okay..Cause you're going to give this away so.Right right..Yeah so one two.use one move--.So, okay..then you can salvage Temple of the Moon just because..Okay..Okay..And then.Flip that.Oh so I have to--.flip this one..Mhm..One two three four five six so I'm going to get rid of the fire card..Alright..Mhm..And.And make one two.Never..Then--.Uh..And I gotta, I gotta draw..Yup. Two treasure cards..Yeah..Okay..The right hand..Sandbags. Okay yeah perfect..Oh..Two of those..So.Three..Cliff's of Abandon,.Whispering Garden,.and okay so Whispering Garden is fine..Whipsering Garden is gone. Okay..Alright so Whispering--.Cliff's of Abandon..Cliff's of Abandon, right here this is Cliff's..Breaker's Bridge..Okay..I'm headed right here..Okay..So.So I'm gonna.go.one.one two.two three, capture..One.Okay..two.three..Get the chalice..And.two of these..Then, yup..Oh awesome. Statue and the fire..Then.three so one.two.Temple of the Sun,.three..Crimson Forest,.and Copper Gate..Copper Gate..Where's that one..Copper Gate..Copper Gate, yeah..Okay..And now it's my turn..So.I am right here..Doesn't make sense for me to flip anything over..I think you should go to Temple of the Sun just to flip that over to make sure that it doesn't um.Flip it?.Okay..get sunk..Is there anybody--.Okay..Okay..Oh..And I could shoreline something but do we really need to? No?.No..Okay.that's my turn..Two cards..Rising waters so.one two three four five..I'm going to discard--.Um.Did we already kept the chalice?.We already got the chalice, yeah..Yeah we already got the chalice, yeah..Yeah I'm going to discard this one.and um we're going to--.We already raised it one..Mhm..Okay shuffle this..I really hope we don't lose that.cause it'll make it hard to move.That would--.from here to here..Yeah that would make it inconvenient..So three.Yeah..Temple of the Sun..Alright yup..Flip that again..Temple of the moon..You should try to save those. Breaker's Bridge..Yeah..Okay you're floating..Alright so we gotta get out of there..Great..So.Alright..So it's your turn..My turn so I need to get to.You should wait wait wait you can use this inside that..You should yeah wait..Yeah that's a good call..Okay..Sandbag which one? This one or that one?.Temple of the Moon Temple of the Moon definitely..Temple of the Moon..Okay..Temple of the Moon okay so I sandbag.And that doesn't count as a move..Temple of the Moon..Then I think you should.flip this as a move..Okay..Well.he can fly here with one of the helicopters or use this..Oh yeah cause you're you're you're here. Yeah I got it. Oh cause you're stuck here on the water..Yeah.Yeah..right..Well he's suck in the water so that means he can float..over.right? That's not a move..Float.here.and uh he can flip that over as a move..Yeah..Okay..So that should be your first move. Flipping that..Okay.flipping that will be my first move..Alright..And, oh god..Your second move could be flying here and flipping that..Oh okay..Second and third move..Second and third move, okay..Yeah.fly over to Temple of the Sun.Alright..flip that.Second and third move..and now you two are on the same card so--.Okay..So now you can give me.one of those on your next.turn..Yeah..Okay..Alright. So now.two cards..Alright.okay..Oh.oh did you use.any of the special powers?.I don't think so..No!.You could probably just discard one..Yeah I'm just gonna discard--.No, don't discard a special power..Well but he has three of the helicopter lifts..Yeah I can--.They can be useful cause they don't count as moves..So.But I, I don't think I would want to get rid of either one of these. Yeah I guess--.Yeah cause I think I think we should give, we should focus on cause we have four of the little stone things all together so we should focus on.Yeah yeah..Yeah I can give him one.And then I can give him one cause we're all, we're all very close to each other..True..Right..Aw well I guess we should've used that..Yeah..Hm..That's your--.So get those two and then I'll have to uh take three of those..Crimson Forest.Is gone..is gone..Copper Gate.is also gone..And.Cliff's of Abandon..Okay (so we're actually)--.Okay so.my turn..Your turn..So I think.You could.move two over.Yeah I was going to move over here..and give him one of those. Okay..Yeah..So one.two.Three.three give you that..Okay..Hm.Now you have to discard something. Uh oh..Oh yeah (I gotta but it's hard)..Yeah discard that one..Okay. Makes sense..Yeah and then.Uh can I check through the discard pile?.It's nothing. I just want to make sure we're not in a field of pursuit with these..Okay..Okay yeah we're good..Now um.Now I guess.three of these..oh yeah three of those..So.Tidal Palace.Silver Gate.and then Dunes of Deception.which we want to keep.open maybe..Or we could just keep playing over here..I don't think we really need Dunes of Deception just cause it's sort of out here on it's own little island and like we can't even like use it to get anywhere..Okay..So now it's your turn..You could give me your card..Wait didn't I just go? Yeah it's your turn..Oh..Oh it's my turn? That was your turn? Okay..So.You should give him.this.Okay..Well then he has to discard one of those..I'd have to, yeah..I guess..But that would give me something. That would give me a.That would give you four for your next turn..treasure. Yeah..Yeah..Okay.um.that's one move..Sandbag doesn't count as a turn..Um--.Uh but there's no point to sandbag anything.cause we're around everything..So I can move.somewhere.Well I think it's, so we've got.all of those lined up so what we need to do is we need to get all of our statue of winds consolidated to each other so.Oh I could uh.you, you could give.I could give them to you..to me and then I could just move over here and we just need one more then we'll get it..Mhm..Okay.so.how many moves am I at?.I gave him one so I'm at two moves I mean I'm at one move so this could be my three moves..That's two new..Hm then--.Yup..Give one to you..Okay..Okay awesome..Yeah..Oh..Oh that's.That's gone..interesting..Where is the fire?.Cause we got the Cave the Cave of Shadows right there and I've got one.Oh..so.Oh your next move could be.give you that.giving me that and I'll move over there..then.Okay..yeah,.exactly..So now it's your move..Well do we have to do the um.Oh yeah..Cave Shadows which we will save..Bronze Gate.Cave of Shadows..Bronze Gate..and Cave Embers..Cave of Embers..So our priority should be that..Okay okay..Yeah..Okay..Alright (wait)..Wait.Oh..discard the water's rising, yeah..Yeah..Okay..Your move..Alright..So my move. Alright..No..Oh wait wait wait, not not yet. Um get the--.Yeah..Oh yeah..Yeah..So I take--.You're already here that's one move..Okay already there so I got it. Alright. That's one move..Oh wait we don't have to do anything..Oh no yeah you just leave that there yeah. You just put those in the treasure discard pile..Yeah just put.right there..Okay..And um.one move you can fly over here and flip it..I think you should fly to the Cave of Shadows and save that.Okay..Two then..Two..Mhm..and then flip it for your third..Flip. Yeah third move, good. Okay..So three moves..And now it is your turn..(I mean) sorry..Well he's gotta take, yeah he's gotta take two..I don't see a good--One two..Alright and now I gotta get um.Mhm..Oh the three..three of three of those..Howling Garden,.Misty Marsh,.and.Watch Tower..Okay..Okay so if in our next move we can capture.this.Yeah then--.or that then we're fine..So.Um.from so my move should be I should give you the fire card..Okay. First move.So.that's one move..Alright..And then.Hm.hm.you can.well if you move.if you move right here you can flip over two cards and then on his next turn he can give you that gold thing.cause he can move there and give you one..So you move here you can flip two cards.as one turn..Can can I flip--.Actually.Yeah,.if.you move.well so on on the next turn you can get the fire so I think I should just move over here to Fool's Landing..oh wait!.Right..Cause on the next move you can go one two--.Oh I guess technically then we'd have to wait..But we don't know what cards you're going to sink..Cause it's very likely that one of us is going to get um a water's rising..But like the only but the only card we have to worry about is the Cave of Shadows.cause we already have two of the statues..Yeah..True. So I just need one more card..Mhm..You don't even need it. No you already have four. Yeah..You got you got four, yeah..Oh I have all four..Oh..Okay..So like we're already set..Mhm..Okay.I guess I can move up right there.and we already have that.so..But we've got to get it first so you've got to get all the way over here..Yeah..Okay..And I'm already I'm with the Pilot..Can you fly me over on a normal turn?.No..Can he like move with a person if you're on the same card?.Is that one of the rules which you can (--).for the Pilot..I don't believe so..Oh..I think it's only the Pilot..I can move one or more pawns..Yeah so he can fly me over.Oh, oh!.Yeah..Perfect..Yeah..whenever. It doesn't matter if we lose anything so yeah, your turn..Yeah..So you can just.Well no isn't it your turn right now?.Wait, it's still my turn?.I'm a little confused..Wait you haven't done anything yet, have you?.Oh,.Yeah..I've done nothing..Yeah..All I need to do is.So just you just need to wind up at the end of your just so you're with the Pilot..Okay.so.So you could go.one, flip,.one.One.flip..back..Yeah..That's your three..Okay..We can wait, yeah..Oh wait I can sandbag. I should just use it because I have it..Oh yeah and that gets rid of it..Um.hm.just so to make things easier.Or wouldn't it, don't do it cause you need.to wind up back here.Uh huh..and so if you go--.No sandbagging let's you shore up any card, anywhere..Oh.Is it.does it--.but.Yeah cause if you moved over here and this wasn't shored up already, then you go one.like two and then three and you wouldn't be able to wind up back here..But if I shore up which doesn't count as a move, I can do one two three..Yeah so sandbagging doesn't count as a move..Oh I thought we were going with that you guys were just going to fly over here together.Well.on his turn..Okay or.or you could just.go over there right now. I think yeah that's probably the best idea..Probably go there now..Yeah..Yeah sandbag and then move..Right..Yeah..So I'll turn this,.use the sandbag,.and then.one.One.two three..two three..Okay..Alright..Okay awesome..And then my next turn I'll get it..Yup..Okay..Okay..Now it's your turn..Alright so, um..Oh wait.I just I have to pull two cards from there..Yeah and the we have to do the--.That's funny..Okay..Another fire card..It was destined. Oh, sorry..This goes over here.and pull three of these..One.is Coral Palace, right here..Uh.yeah..Observatory..Where is that..Observatory..And last card.is the Twilight Hollow..Twilight Hollow..Okay, now it is your turn..Okay..And you can flip things over just for kicks.or.yeah.you can.fly..What do we need to save? Nothing really..I mean I can give you this card..Nothing..But we don't even need.No we don't even, I mean you, you could.just for.fun..Okay..I guess. We just need you to um, wind up on Fool's Landing..Okay..So.So you can give him a card and move one two..Wait, actually.just in case you have to move by yourself,.maybe I should.we should flip this card in case you have to walk over. No you're right there..Yeah he can go right there..Nothing, nothing matters..So--.So I'd say just go.Actually he can move here and flip this.flip--.Hm? He's already here..or.Yeah..I'll, I'll flip it..Yeah yeah yeah..Yeah so--.Yeah..So just flip.Move, flip this..Well flip this first.as one move..Well no this is this is already yeah..Oh..This is good. This is good. So, so what we're you saying?.Darn..Just one--.Wait so go--.He can flip this and this.one turn one turn and move..Yeah I think that's yup. Good call..Alright..Two turns..Then just go to Fool's Landing..Fool's Landing..Fool's Landing, alright alright..(He's there)..Yeah..Then two treasure cards..Two treasure cards, okay..Alright. Okay uh.Another helicopter..Perfect..helicopter and Water Rise. Okay..So you have to play that..Okay so.Move it up..goes up to here..But even without, we're still fine.just cause.you're on the fire place..This was a really good strategy..Yeah..Okay..So Observatory.Observatory's gone..City, Cliff's of Abandon.Cliff's of Abandon..Flipped.and Bronze Gate..Bronze Gate's gone..So now it is--.Okay.my turn..Yeah..So.You can flip two things over just for kicks..Where are you?.I'm down here..You're red, oh..Oh..One..One two flip something over.

Um, I have two chalices and I'm right here.So.I'm gonna.flip Lost Lagoon and Temple of the Moon.Wait wait. Oh.Uh, I think.just to like.there might be a way for you to flip all four cards.Like if you.take one move here.you can flip.these two cards and if you move there you can flip those two cards.Oh flip those two. Yeah that's a good call. Okay so.Or wait a minute. If you do this first, you can flip these two and then move here and flip those two and you'll be closer to that.Okay yeah.I like that move.Okay so I'm gonna move here, that's one.Actually wait no that, cause then I'd have to move down here and that'd be another move, yeah.If you flip it (right)--.Oh, true.That's that would be three moves.But then on your next move you can f--.Yeah that's true so I'm just gonna--.One.Two three.So that's two moves there.How is it, oh.Cause I had to move over one and then yeah.Move. Oh.One.Okay.then flip those and then I guess move down here.Those are my moves. Um then two treasure cards.a.Okay.Thank you. Alright water is rising card.(So I got a--).So Temple of the Moon.and Phantom Rock so.Temple of the Moon.Phantom Rocks is removed.Hm Phantom Rock. Alright so Phantom Rock's gone.Okay wow. Alright.Then waters rising goes back over there.And then.your turn.Okay.right? Yeah.So.I can flip this.for one move.Mhm.and.I can move here, flip this.and that will be my three moves.Yeah cause I also think it's important that we get you near the Cave of Shadows cause then I can give you that and hopefully you'll get a fire card.Alright.Okay.on the next turn so we can like start like moving towards getting the um.statues.So.move.and.shore up.Three moves.and I'm going to pull two cards.Not lion,.sandbags,.Alright so maybe we should--.Well I can move back there afterwards.Yeah.And now.pull two of these.Mhm.Got.Lost Lagoon and Cliff's--.Alright so Lost Lagoon is gone.City, Cliff's of Abandon.Oh.Okay.Here you go.That's cities. No that's cliffs.I don't know why I keep saying cities.Alright, cool.Alright.So um in my case I'm at Fool's Landing already.Um.Um.We've got, you've got two of the statues. You got two of the chalices.Yeah.Actually right now.Um.you could fly here and move then shore up.Flip it over yeah. I guess I could do that.Yeah.So.Cause also when you're down here you're right in the centralized location of all four statues.Right.Yeah.which is, and Fool's Landing. So like this is like the important little quadrant.(--).Yeah.Okay so this is one.and then.And.let's (--).you could.fly somewhere else but like I'm right here so I can flip that on the next move.Yeah I mean I think it's important that we all stay kind of like down here because like all four of the statues are down here and then Fool's Landing is right there too.Guess you could just move up one.Yeah.And that's.that's two and then (--).Yeah and then just you can move one more yeah.Just move somewhere (on your way --).Alright.Or you could've moved through there and flipped it over.Oh.Oh.okay.Oh well I mean yeah it's only Cliff's of Abandon. It doesn't really have any like big--.Okay.Things on it.Two and one two.Two.And I just flipped them for you.Two yeah.Breaker's Bridge and Gold Gate.(--) Breaker's Bridge.Your turn.Alright so.Okay.um I'll.Oh.if you're here, if you move here you can flip both of those in the next move.and so that would be two moves.So one.two.And.and then.move next to a chalice.Oh.Yeah so I'll just move.back down.Oh no where's the chalice thingy.Where'd--.There?.Oh.okay.Yeah it's closer than over here.Okay.As soon as we move down there that's three. Two treasure cards.Oh perfect.Got a chalice and this thing. Five cards.Okay.Um.Whispering Garden Iron Gate.Iron Gate. So Iron Gate and then Whispering Garden.Garden, yeah.Okay.Alright.And my turn.So.do we, should I save my sandbag?.I have two of these.and (--) is right here.Or actually right there.So I can move one two and flip well one two and flip.for my three moves.unless.yeah.You could do that or.what I think you should do is I think you should go.one.Two.two.three.and then.because--.Well I only have two right now so.That's true but if you, if we like stay down here there's the four statues, yeah so then like whenever anything like, yeah.We can get everything.So don't worry about that part of the board?.So whenever anything gets like sunk or like gets flooded, like one of us is always going to be around. Yeah exactly.We can save them here.One of us could jump in and that's right.Okay.And then Fool's Landing is right there too.Yeah, right.Wait should I give any of my cards to anybody?.At this point, no.I don't.I don't think so, no.I'll give you mine when it gets to that point.Yeah exactly so then I can just get the chalice on the next turn, yeah.Right.Okay so one.two.three.and that's my three actions.Okay.One two waters rise.and.chalice.so--.Well okay.Alright so.Move up the water level one.so now we have to shuffle.So three so.Gold Gate,.Well Gold Gate's gone.Iron Gate,.and Temple of the Moon.What does that even mean.Okay Gold Gate's gone and Iron Gate's gone.Okay.Yeah.Gold Gate and Iron Gate.Temp--.What do these little things on there mean?.I think that's um.that's just where we originate.Oh.Yeah.Okay.Okay so--.And now it's your turn.Okay.Yup.Alright so I'll give you mine.Oh wait.Oh you have to be on the same--.Oh that's right I have to go, that's right. You're right.Oh discard discard.Wait discard the waters rises yeah yeah yeah.Yeah yeah okay okay.Yeah, okay.Are you on the same one?.So I'm not uh so you're.you're here.Right there and you can fly there.So I can just go, I can just fly there, right?.Yeah so you just go, yup.Mhm.So one.So I can fly there if I, that didn't have to count as a move,.Yes it does. Well.does it?.Yeah cause that's your special power so that--.Oh.well.Unless--.you can either use this, which I think you might want to save for a little bit later cause right now you don't have any other cards.um.Okay.Cause you're going to give this away so.Right right.Yeah so one two.use one move--.So, okay.then you can salvage Temple of the Moon just because.Okay.Okay.And then.Flip that.Oh so I have to--.flip this one.Mhm.One two three four five six so I'm going to get rid of the fire card.Alright.Mhm.And.And make one two.Never.Then--.Uh.And I gotta, I gotta draw.Yup. Two treasure cards.Yeah.Okay.The right hand.Sandbags. Okay yeah perfect.Oh.Two of those.So.Three.Cliff's of Abandon,.Whispering Garden,.and okay so Whispering Garden is fine.Whipsering Garden is gone. Okay.Alright so Whispering--.Cliff's of Abandon.Cliff's of Abandon, right here this is Cliff's.Breaker's Bridge.Okay.I'm headed right here.Okay.So.So I'm gonna.go.one.one two.two three, capture.One.Okay.two.three.Get the chalice.And.two of these.Then, yup.Oh awesome. Statue and the fire.Then.three so one.two.Temple of the Sun,.three.Crimson Forest,.and Copper Gate.Copper Gate.Where's that one.Copper Gate.Copper Gate, yeah.Okay.And now it's my turn.So.I am right here.Doesn't make sense for me to flip anything over.I think you should go to Temple of the Sun just to flip that over to make sure that it doesn't um.Flip it?.Okay.get sunk.Is there anybody--.Okay.Okay.Oh.And I could shoreline something but do we really need to? No?.No.Okay.that's my turn.Two cards.Rising waters so.one two three four five.I'm going to discard--.Um.Did we already kept the chalice?.We already got the chalice, yeah.Yeah we already got the chalice, yeah.Yeah I'm going to discard this one.and um we're going to--.We already raised it one.Mhm.Okay shuffle this.I really hope we don't lose that.cause it'll make it hard to move.That would--.from here to here.Yeah that would make it inconvenient.So three.Yeah.Temple of the Sun.Alright yup.Flip that again.Temple of the moon.You should try to save those. Breaker's Bridge.Yeah.Okay you're floating.Alright so we gotta get out of there.Great.So.Alright.So it's your turn.My turn so I need to get to.You should wait wait wait you can use this inside that.You should yeah wait.Yeah that's a good call.Okay.Sandbag which one? This one or that one?.Temple of the Moon Temple of the Moon definitely.Temple of the Moon.Okay.Temple of the Moon okay so I sandbag.And that doesn't count as a move.Temple of the Moon.Then I think you should.flip this as a move.Okay.Well.he can fly here with one of the helicopters or use this.Oh yeah cause you're you're you're here. Yeah I got it. Oh cause you're stuck here on the water.Yeah.Yeah.right.Well he's suck in the water so that means he can float.over.right? That's not a move.Float.here.and uh he can flip that over as a move.Yeah.Okay.So that should be your first move. Flipping that.Okay.flipping that will be my first move.Alright.And, oh god.Your second move could be flying here and flipping that.Oh okay.Second and third move.Second and third move, okay.Yeah.fly over to Temple of the Sun.Alright.flip that.Second and third move.and now you two are on the same card so--.Okay.So now you can give me.one of those on your next.turn.Yeah.Okay.Alright. So now.two cards.Alright.okay.Oh.oh did you use.any of the special powers?.I don't think so.No!.You could probably just discard one.Yeah I'm just gonna discard--.No, don't discard a special power.Well but he has three of the helicopter lifts.Yeah I can--.They can be useful cause they don't count as moves.So.But I, I don't think I would want to get rid of either one of these. Yeah I guess--.Yeah cause I think I think we should give, we should focus on cause we have four of the little stone things all together so we should focus on.Yeah yeah.Yeah I can give him one.And then I can give him one cause we're all, we're all very close to each other.True.Right.Aw well I guess we should've used that.Yeah.Hm.That's your--.So get those two and then I'll have to uh take three of those.Crimson Forest.Is gone.is gone.Copper Gate.is also gone.And.Cliff's of Abandon.Okay (so we're actually)--.Okay so.my turn.Your turn.So I think.You could.move two over.Yeah I was going to move over here.and give him one of those. Okay.Yeah.So one.two.Three.three give you that.Okay.Hm.Now you have to discard something. Uh oh.Oh yeah (I gotta but it's hard).Yeah discard that one.Okay. Makes sense.Yeah and then.Uh can I check through the discard pile?.It's nothing. I just want to make sure we're not in a field of pursuit with these.Okay.Okay yeah we're good.Now um.Now I guess.three of these.oh yeah three of those.So.Tidal Palace.Silver Gate.and then Dunes of Deception.which we want to keep.open maybe.Or we could just keep playing over here.I don't think we really need Dunes of Deception just cause it's sort of out here on it's own little island and like we can't even like use it to get anywhere.Okay.So now it's your turn.You could give me your card.Wait didn't I just go? Yeah it's your turn.Oh.Oh it's my turn? That was your turn? Okay.So.You should give him.this.Okay.Well then he has to discard one of those.I'd have to, yeah.I guess.But that would give me something. That would give me a.That would give you four for your next turn.treasure. Yeah.Yeah.Okay.um.that's one move.Sandbag doesn't count as a turn.Um--.Uh but there's no point to sandbag anything.cause we're around everything.So I can move.somewhere.Well I think it's, so we've got.all of those lined up so what we need to do is we need to get all of our statue of winds consolidated to each other so.Oh I could uh.you, you could give.I could give them to you.to me and then I could just move over here and we just need one more then we'll get it.Mhm.Okay.so.how many moves am I at?.I gave him one so I'm at two moves I mean I'm at one move so this could be my three moves.That's two new.Hm then--.Yup.Give one to you.Okay.Okay awesome.Yeah.Oh.Oh that's.That's gone.interesting.Where is the fire?.Cause we got the Cave the Cave of Shadows right there and I've got one.Oh.so.Oh your next move could be.give you that.giving me that and I'll move over there.then.Okay.yeah,.exactly.So now it's your move.Well do we have to do the um.Oh yeah.Cave Shadows which we will save.Bronze Gate.Cave of Shadows.Bronze Gate.and Cave Embers.Cave of Embers.So our priority should be that.Okay okay.Yeah.Okay.Alright (wait).Wait.Oh.discard the water's rising, yeah.Yeah.Okay.Your move.Alright.So my move. Alright.No.Oh wait wait wait, not not yet. Um get the--.Yeah.Oh yeah.Yeah.So I take--.You're already here that's one move.Okay already there so I got it. Alright. That's one move.Oh wait we don't have to do anything.Oh no yeah you just leave that there yeah. You just put those in the treasure discard pile.Yeah just put.right there.Okay.And um.one move you can fly over here and flip it.I think you should fly to the Cave of Shadows and save that.Okay.Two then.Two.Mhm.and then flip it for your third.Flip. Yeah third move, good. Okay.So three moves.And now it is your turn.(I mean) sorry.Well he's gotta take, yeah he's gotta take two.I don't see a good--One two.Alright and now I gotta get um.Mhm.Oh the three.three of three of those.Howling Garden,.Misty Marsh,.and.Watch Tower.Okay.Okay so if in our next move we can capture.this.Yeah then--.or that then we're fine.So.Um.from so my move should be I should give you the fire card.Okay. First move.So.that's one move.Alright.And then.Hm.hm.you can.well if you move.if you move right here you can flip over two cards and then on his next turn he can give you that gold thing.cause he can move there and give you one.So you move here you can flip two cards.as one turn.Can can I flip--.Actually.Yeah,.if.you move.well so on on the next turn you can get the fire so I think I should just move over here to Fool's Landing.oh wait!.Right.Cause on the next move you can go one two--.Oh I guess technically then we'd have to wait.But we don't know what cards you're going to sink.Cause it's very likely that one of us is going to get um a water's rising.But like the only but the only card we have to worry about is the Cave of Shadows.cause we already have two of the statues.Yeah.True. So I just need one more card.Mhm.You don't even need it. No you already have four. Yeah.You got you got four, yeah.Oh I have all four.Oh.Okay.So like we're already set.Mhm.Okay.I guess I can move up right there.and we already have that.so.But we've got to get it first so you've got to get all the way over here.Yeah.Okay.And I'm already I'm with the Pilot.Can you fly me over on a normal turn?.No.Can he like move with a person if you're on the same card?.Is that one of the rules which you can (--).for the Pilot.I don't believe so.Oh.I think it's only the Pilot.I can move one or more pawns.Yeah so he can fly me over.Oh, oh!.Yeah.Perfect.Yeah.whenever. It doesn't matter if we lose anything so yeah, your turn.Yeah.So you can just.Well no isn't it your turn right now?.Wait, it's still my turn?.I'm a little confused.Wait you haven't done anything yet, have you?.Oh,.Yeah.I've done nothing.Yeah.All I need to do is.So just you just need to wind up at the end of your just so you're with the Pilot.Okay.so.So you could go.one, flip,.one.One.flip.back.Yeah.That's your three.Okay.We can wait, yeah.Oh wait I can sandbag. I should just use it because I have it.Oh yeah and that gets rid of it.Um.hm.just so to make things easier.Or wouldn't it, don't do it cause you need.to wind up back here.Uh huh.and so if you go--.No sandbagging let's you shore up any card, anywhere.Oh.Is it.does it--.but.Yeah cause if you moved over here and this wasn't shored up already, then you go one.like two and then three and you wouldn't be able to wind up back here.But if I shore up which doesn't count as a move, I can do one two three.Yeah so sandbagging doesn't count as a move.Oh I thought we were going with that you guys were just going to fly over here together.Well.on his turn.Okay or.or you could just.go over there right now. I think yeah that's probably the best idea.Probably go there now.Yeah.Yeah sandbag and then move.Right.Yeah.So I'll turn this,.use the sandbag,.and then.one.One.two three.two three.Okay.Alright.Okay awesome.And then my next turn I'll get it.Yup.Okay.Okay.Now it's your turn.Alright so, um.Oh wait.I just I have to pull two cards from there.Yeah and the we have to do the--.That's funny.Okay.Another fire card.It was destined. Oh, sorry.This goes over here.and pull three of these.One.is Coral Palace, right here.Uh.yeah.Observatory.Where is that.Observatory.And last card.is the Twilight Hollow.Twilight Hollow.Okay, now it is your turn.Okay.And you can flip things over just for kicks.or.yeah.you can.fly.What do we need to save? Nothing really.I mean I can give you this card.Nothing.But we don't even need.No we don't even, I mean you, you could.just for.fun.Okay.I guess. We just need you to um, wind up on Fool's Landing.Okay.So.So you can give him a card and move one two.Wait, actually.just in case you have to move by yourself,.maybe I should.we should flip this card in case you have to walk over. No you're right there.Yeah he can go right there.Nothing, nothing matters.So--.So I'd say just go.Actually he can move here and flip this.flip--.Hm? He's already here.or.Yeah.I'll, I'll flip it.Yeah yeah yeah.Yeah so--.Yeah.So just flip.Move, flip this.Well flip this first.as one move.Well no this is this is already yeah.Oh.This is good. This is good. So, so what we're you saying?.Darn.Just one--.Wait so go--.He can flip this and this.one turn one turn and move.Yeah I think that's yup. Good call.Alright.Two turns.Then just go to Fool's Landing.Fool's Landing.Fool's Landing, alright alright.(He's there).Yeah.Then two treasure cards.Two treasure cards, okay.Alright. Okay uh.Another helicopter.Perfect.helicopter and Water Rise. Okay.So you have to play that.Okay so.Move it up.goes up to here.But even without, we're still fine.just cause.you're on the fire place.This was a really good strategy.Yeah.Okay.So Observatory.Observatory's gone.City, Cliff's of Abandon.Cliff's of Abandon.Flipped.and Bronze Gate.Bronze Gate's gone.So now it is--.Okay.my turn.Yeah.So.You can flip two things over just for kicks.Where are you?.I'm down here.You're red, oh.Oh.One.One two flip something over. Flip flip those two. No yeah you can flip one. You can flip one.Yeah good call.Yeah yeah yeah.One.two.Two.three.Three.Okay and now two cards.Yup. Two treasure cards.Oh there's a lot of these sling things.Yeah.Then three water's rise cards.So Cave of Embers.Gone.Howling Garden, gone.Howling Gardens, gone.And then.Temple of the Moon, flipped.Um.oh.Alright so now it's your turn.And I'm going to.collect this for one turn.Oh you keep one of them though cause you only need four.Oh.Well where's the chalice? Right here?.This whole fire thing is yours.And now.So that's one, flip this.flip something.and move here three.And um.now two of these.Sandbag.this whole thing.And three of these.Three water's rising cards.Dunes of Deception, Watch Tower,.and Coral Palace.(--).(--).Coral Palace right here.And Coral Palace.Hm.and so.it's that and done.Mhm.Use your--.Fly us out.Hm, fly us out.Okay.Killed

Flip that one and that one..I mean he could just go there..(--)..Oh yeah..But being in a helicopter is cool though so I flew..Two..Three..Okay..Nice..Nice..Golden Gate..Whispering Garden..Golden Gate's gone..Whispering Garden..Okay..So.So.I can flip that one back over..Can you get--you should--.Can you.wait no that's me..Nevermind..Oh that is you..Um.Oh I'm right here..Yeah she's green..We can move diagonal here and flip that..Yeah, do that..One, two..I think but you should also give her this..So then I just gotta have one..Yeah..Mhhm..One.Shore me up..Oh no..No..Well that'd be four moves then..Yeah..So.Well still move there, flip that, and then give her the card as your third..flip it..I can't..She has to be on the same tile..Well no I have to--.I can be on a different tile..Oh oh oh oh..Um..I can move to your tile..You can come to my tile..Yeah..Hm..Cause then you'll still be on my tile when it's--.Let's--but you can use your sand--you're always given a sandbag..Mhhm..Um--.But it's early in the game..Right..And if we lose this--.I would--she she should move here. Then we have somebody over here just in case something happens..And she's still somewhat close but she she can move diagonally..Right..So you're saying stay at Cliffs of Abandon?.Or she should move here. That way if something happens over here she's at least close by. (--) she's still kinda close by..Oh Twilight Hollow..And I can still move to you, one..So we're not trying to give her the card?.Wait..I can still go to her next turn..That's--.Yeah I wouldn't..Okay..Is that good?.Yeah, no..Do I need to go back then?.Did you flip, oh you flipped me you flipped me. Okay..I flipped it..Oh good..And two flood cards..Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate..Okay..Alright..Hm..Do you wanna give her that card?.This one?.I could do it..I mean..I'm trying to think..Oh no you're red. I can't remember..We should try to keep you close to these three so you can flip two cards at once..Also you can maybe be the one who's going to do the fire..Yeah..Mhm..So what if I just go.I should try to do this thing because I can fly back to you guys close so I can (--) so it's kinda out of the way..So.I could just move--.I think Explorer should do.the Lion. She has two already..Mhm..Okay hm..And you can use the helicopter card to fly her.Okay..And give it..to uh Whispering Garden..So should I just move here so I could always.(--)..Mhhm..Whatever you do..Should you..Yeah that's good..I'm just trying to think if I should--.Shore up..Should you shore up?.Shore up what?.That card or no..Hm..Well eh..Like what if I go here.here just so I can give you this.rather than.just keep carrying in..I mean we both have one so like you don't know if.Oh..Yeah I'm gonna draw one or.Who's gonna get the next one?.Yeah..You know Pilot will draw two or something..But you know also give the cards back to her from anywhere..Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah..Yeah, wherever I am..Okay..Oh yeah..If like she were to draw two just now, you could.That's fine..One.One action..two.Two action..three..Three..I'm really sorry guys..Okay..I feel like it's on purpose..We'll probably all lose that. Temple of the Moon..Oh I forgot that one was there..But if we lose the other thing, the other two don't matter..Three..Right..One.two.three..Temple's of the Moon, Breaker's Bridge..Temple of the Moon..Breaker's Bridge.and Cliff's of Abandon..Okay..Alright so,.I.I'm gonna.stay where I am or.make my way to Temple of the Sun.so I can cash these in..Oh..Oh..Eventually..Hopefully..I feel like we should shore that up..Which one?.Yeah you could shore.this up and then--.Shore that up and then move there..Breaker's Bridge..Either way you're in you're in you're in--.Shore both of them and then just move one..I mean you're in the middle (that we can move you close)..Yeah..Okay..Because you have two of each..So one..Hm..Two..No shore that up first..One, two.Oh oh one two--.and then just move there..Then move--.Perfect..There we go..Good. Alright..Sandbags.and this..Good..Nice..You have to discard. Sorry..Oh yeah..One two, one two.Just use a sandbag on something..I mean she still has to discard..I have to I still have to get rid of it..You have to discard two..Oh..Should I get rid of.You're the only one that--.Probably..One of these..Well can you--.You're the only one with a chalice..Yeah they can't till their turn..Yeah..Aw..We're thinking.I mean I.wouldn't give up this one and I shouldn't..I have three of these so.Right. So you have too..Which one should we flip over..So we can use the sandbag..Yeah you don't have to cause it doesn't count as a turn. Why don't you just discard it..Right..Can we even use it?.But I--.Can we use that sandbag?.No because I drew it..You have to yeah you have to--.And I'd have to discard it cause I can only have five..Okay..Yeah so we can't use it. Okay..So we're.So I--.Yeah..So we're done..Well, yeah we don't need.So--.Do we need to do the floods?.Hm--.Yup..Lost Lagoon,.Iron Gate..Nice..Whispering Garden..Mh hm..That's--.Iron Gate? No..Nope..Lost Lagoon..Okay..Pilot..So--.They'll probably get this one..We should give her this card..Mhm..Oh yeah..But you have to be on the same spot as me..Oh okay..Who are--Oh you could no--.How close are you.I think you should move one,.shore up that..I'm going to move here. No I can't move there..Well you can, no yeah you could fly..Well you can fly..Alright..Okay, fly there..And that's your move..Give her the card and move here..But I can't shore that up though..Oh right..What.if.you.you gave me the card..Oh wait..We'd have to be relying on this getting shored up..Cause then you could give me two when you move to me..What if--.He's on the same spot as you right now, right?.He gives you.Both cards..either one cause I can give you this or I can give you this..Or you could give her both..I can give you both.and then.And then move but you still can't shore it up. You can only give her one card..So it'd be--.I would say just fly and give her the card and--.Why can't you just, no you can't sandbag them..(--) we could rescue it..Cause then.Could rescue--.But then someone else gets three turns too so.Explorer could.move over,.shore up,.and then cash in..Just have to hope that we didn't get a flood..For a.I could--.But still see people are closer to this. It really wouldn't, we could rescue it..Mhm..Okay..Right..So--.Just.So actually, we can save and bag this..I can give you these two cards, I can even move here..That way if it happens, I'm there..Mhm..It's like at some point, I don't go that whole round but.Yeah..I think, that's how you should do it..Shit..Give me this one, right?.So one,.I can give you this..Yeah..two.Two.and then--.Fly there--.three..Just move there just in case or should I, does it matter?.I don't think it really matters..Yeah..Okay..Cause it's--.Move--.Um.Wait hold hold on..I have exactly five now..Okay..Just saying..Oh oh yeah..Can you just--.No you can't give it to her. Okay..Alright..Wait wait..I can give, why can't I can't give one to her..Well she needs a sandbag card and I can give her one..Yeah..Then we don't lose the piece..Yeah I think that would be better..Use this.Yeah just use that to save him..and then instead.To save the Whispering Garden..Then give her the fi--give her the fire one cause you'll get you'll get these ones..Oh yeah well doesn't matter..Oh I think I should get the fire..I could give you either..Oh wait I thought you meant I thought you meant I use this and lion goes to the Explorer..Oh..(You use--).No cause I'm on the c--.Oh you have to be on the same thing as.Mhm..the person..Anyways who you give it to..So I thought it was.Oh yeah..you.Pilot fly to Twilight hollow is one,.give the card to Explorer two.and then if I just use this it doesn't count as a move for you but I would..Whispering Garden would be safe..Okay,.I like that..For (--) but she can't--giving three cards counts as three actions..Oh you're giving three cards?.Or she's gonna have to give her three cards..Cause--.She just has to give me this..She--so she can't move. Oh..I could just give her that..For once we're trying to get near--.And then I can get this one.out of the way..And then wait you could--cause you would go here--.Oh no..This is so hard..I got--.We're thinking too much this game..I know..Are we still on your turn right now? Okay. And this is where you originally were..Yeah I still I still have a move I still.Okay let's move one at a time..yeah so I have I have one action still..I think.So you,.you should--.all you did was give two cards that's--okay..I should I should take one of those.back..I would take lion back.Then she could she could still give me those. She could give me those two. Keep the fire one give me the lion back..and.I don't know..I got an idea. Okay..Okay. You just you go for it right now..Do you wanna do another.Cause then and then she (--)..move..I say fly.to Twilight Hollow.give her the lion card.so she has three.and then.Then she can give her cards to.yeah. Cause then.if I use this, Whispering Garden's.safe..Hm. Okay..And that's three moves..Right..Are we are we using that now?.I can play it anytime..Yeah..You--.Hm--.Wait can you play it once I pick up a water card. Like I pick the card up can we use it?.I don't--I feel like no..Hmmh.I don't think so but I am also I'm just as close..Yeah yeah..So I should use it?.Well yeah..So we have that still. Okay (--) okay..Sure. Save it? Okay..Okay just save the sandbag..But then wait sorry..But like isn't more important for you to pick up treasures right now? So like.I guess you can discard the sandbag at any time but why not use it.Mhm..when we could use it..Does that make any sense?.Well she but she's not picking up like cards for a while. She can use it until your turn..Yeah I have--.Yeah we can we can wait until your turn wait yeah..We can wait..Mhm..Alright so we're good?.Yeah..I think so..That's a long time..Nice..Okay. Three of those..Hm there goes that..Uh!.But she can still use it before it's my turn..Forest and the Copper Gate. Where is that at..Okay..Alright..Okay..Alright..I am going to.Go to me.right?.go to you..And get rid of fire..Yeah..That's two..And then you can shore up..And I can still shore up this..Mhm that's three..Okay..We're still at 30..Two of those pieces don't matter so.Mhm..Copper Gate, Breaker's Bridge, Cliff's of Abandon..Okay..Which one did you get rid of?.Copper Gate..Alright..So now..I'll go here..Mhm..Yay..Discard those..Okay and.I'm on the same one..You oh..As me but what does it--.No before you move before you moved you should've gave her that card..Okay..So could we (--) that..So we're just gonna.Keep the take the--.reverse and I'm at.two actions now..So we yeah..I've had two actions so I have one more..Yeah..So you gave her the card before you moved, you moved there was two, and collecting the treasure was three..Three..Okay..Good..Okay cool..No..Why?.Oh..It's you this time..Discard the fire..Oh yeah that's what we just got..Okay..Now you pick two cards..All I need to flood.And then draw those, sorry..Sorry (--) turn..Whispering Garden..You need one more..And Crimson.Alright..Crimson Forest.Crimson Forest..and Howling Garden is gone..Oh..So.I need to make it there before it--.Somebody--.I would say it's pretty vital to sandbag..Retweet..Unless she can get there..No or or you can fly her there..I was gonna say--.Oh yeah..Wait wait wait I was gonna say I have three of these..I should go here.to get.your.Earth.Mhm..Nice..and then you can use one of those to fly me here..And then I collect..Would it--.That's my three moves..Wait..Move,.And use the sandbag at any time so it's fine..get--.Yeah..Wait can I give you a piece?.No I I would--.Can you give me--oh no you can't give me unless.Yeah.if you're on the same.thing as her..But I it's not my turn..It'd be her turn giving me the card..Alright point..That's a good point..Um.so--.Somehow we have to.Yeah this is important..Aw man..I would say.We still we still have three helicopter thingies..Yeah..Yeah I don't think there's anything you can do right now.Well I can move to Coral Palace and then flip.other than--.We should we should fly her there and have her turn this one and this one over..those..Mhm..And then just.be here.Yeah..so then we don't have to use a turn later..Mhm..Yeah so so fly fly--.Well she can't--.Okay..Oh.I'm flying you to here..That--.And--.So she needs a turn yet right? That doesn't count as a turn?.And that doesn't count as--.And then.I could use all three to boom boom boom..Yeah..Yeah..Are you going to move here though?.She can't. She can't move diagonally..Oh well then.no yeah I can't even move..Unless you flew her here..And she flipped this one over..And this one..She can't do it that's di--that's diagonal you can't do that one..Wait.so if we're here.But like if you flew her here.free--.Mhm..One,.Flip flip move..two,.move three..Yeah..Yeah leave--.So I mean Breaker's Bridge but--.Which is fine. Okay..Okay..Yeah..Sweet..No. Not sweet..Oh. Damn. Okay so I'll just discard them..Oh not sweet..No keep those cause I'll give you these two..Well I have five..But she can't she has too many cards..Oh yeah..Okay..Move the sandbag..Well look we already have this this.Get rid of the rock. I have a rock and she has a rock thing..Yeah..So get rid of two or get rid of.I would say just get rid of these cause we don't have to worry about that one we have the we have the two..Oh yeah..Back to square one where I was yeah..Okay..Yeah okay..Alright now the flood..Dunes of Deception..Silver Gate..and Cave of Embers..Nice..Okay..That one really doesn't matter..Okay..Okay..So now it's your turn..Somehow you have to give her.You should give her this..Mhm..I think..Mhm..And then she--.Are you on the same spot as her?.You're not on my space..Why don't you just use the sandbag? No..What?.Nothing just--.You--.Unless you just went one two, give me the card, three..He can fly himself there..Yeah fly yourself.Yeah..to her, give her the card..Fly myself here..Yeah give her that card..Give her this card..And either.shore up or move somewhere..One two three four five then I have six cards..Unless you want to move to--.Yeah so why don't you use the sandbag.What if what if I use this helicopter to fly her already on the space cause I have an extra one..Well she has six right now so just use the sandbag..Oh right..Why. Wait we have a situation..Oh I see what you're saying..I just.use the sandbag..Get rid just get rid of this..I would have to discard it though. I don't think it would--.Oh yeah..Just get rid, we already have enough..Okay..So I just used one two, I have one more..You either shore up or move..I'll just shore this up since.Or should he move to Fool's Landing?.Oh you should move her here..Why not?.I guess you can do it anytime..Yeah..Okay..Should I shore this up since I'm there..Yeah..Okay..Okay..So I.need to come here.Mhm..Mhm..One..Oh wait..No?.No she's no she's gonna--Point to us..Oh I didn't I didn't.Oh..You need to draw the flood levels..Oh..I see..(Yes we had something)..Getting too ambitious..I think we need three..(--) one more..Oh..We can't count either..So Bronze Gate..This flip this..Right at the Gate over there..Bronze Gate?.Yeah and Coral Palace..Okay..Oo..It's (--)..It's fine I'll just fix it..Okay you'll just fix it..Okay..So you should move here..One..Take your prize..My prize..Two..Um shore--.Yeah shore this up..Yeah..Mhm..Yup and then that's it..You don't need this right?.No I have four..Okay..Okay..Okay so we're pretty good..Nice..Um..Misty Marsh..Temple of the Sun..Watch Tower..Okay..So.We need that..I'm going to.do two adjacent tiles at the same time since we need Fool's Landing..So that's one..Two..Mhm..Um.and I don't think that I really should do anything else..But I'd move here..I moved to Fool--.Oh yeah. Fool's Landing..Fool's Landing. One..One..Well that was two, three..Two..Yeah. You're good..Yeah it's okay..Yeah okay..Nice idea..Oh my gosh..Can't--.Okay we're still at three..At least we got another helicopter in case we get a water card..Mhm..At least it's not gonna be Fool's Landing that we kick out..Temple of the Sun..My goodness..Misty Marsh..And Dunes of Deception..Okay..Alright..Alright..Alright..So I'm just gonna go.One two collect..One two--.One two.Fly her. Fly her. Just let's fly..collect..Well oh yeah I'm gonna fly you there..Why..Cause it's a free move I guess..Free move..Yeah we have it we have it..But what if we need to fly people here..I have two cards..And he can fly himself..And I can fly myself..Hm..But we still need one to fly out..Why don't--.That's true. Okay..I mean either I mean I guess it doesn't matter either way cause you're gonna have to come back up..Hm..Yeah..I mean one two collect is three moves so I can just do that..Well one two collect.you're good. Yeah that's a good point..Then--.Should we try--.Can we just fly people now or are we not--.Should we wait for his turn?.It doesn't count as an action so..We can fly you here..You have to be flown cause you're--.You here..Two..Does she have a card right..Mhm..Mhm..And we didn't solve one left by my turn I'll just fly myself there and we'll leave..Yeah..Wait so you just flew two people.and that's you..Yeah that's one..Yeah..Yeah..Okay..Nice..So I can even just move there..So--.You need to pick up your water cards..Oh yeah..Well she has to do that..I have to still do these and then those..You didn't do this. (--)..Oh wow..So yeah. It doesn't matter..One..Silver Gate, Breaker's Bridge, Cliff's of Abandon..Silver Gate..Cliffs of Abandon, Breaker's Bridge is fine..My turn..Now fly yourself and fly us out..Fly us here and fly us out..Okay..Here we go..We beat it by a little bit..Two minutes.We definitely over thunk that..Yeah..My one turn lasted like four minutes though.

Consistency is good cause we'll know.Okay.Thank you.Don't I have to shuffle because.Another good thing the Explorer did.Yeah shuffle, wait she has to shuffle those.I have to shuffle.Everybody else knows how to do these.but me.Mhm.Oh no.(--).No no.I didn't. It started lower than.Okay.Now we're good.I was gonna say, I thought you did that.I could've (--) it too.We shouldn't totally though forget about these (--) just in case.Yeah.Okay.Phantom Rock.That's going.You wanna deal that?.Okay bye.Lost Lagoon.And one of you slipped.That doesn't matter either.That shit's pretty insignificant.Okay.Awesome.Good.No.Um.Okay.You are there.You should give.Hm.either of your cards, one to me or one.to the Engineer. So that's your.Yeah.special power.And there's nothing.like that.Like you can't reach any place to--.I'm gonna keep them just in case.I would keep this one cause I could keep moving forward this way and come to here.Mhm.And I could always give you.What if you draw two rock.cards the next. Then you'd have three and you'd try to worry about (giving them to get them back).Mhm. Yeah.Cause (--) has one.So I'll keep these for now and just move.Okay.Yeah.Cause if we're focusing on--.Yeah.This area.I guess you don't really need to do anything else.But I'm going to.move this way, three.Mhm.Yeah.Yeah.Okay.And then draw.Oh yeah.Sandbags.Nice.And Earth.Nice.There we go. That's what we needed.Mhm.(Four) cards.Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge.Okay.Good.Okay.Yup.Um.Should I fly to Breaker's Bridge and flip those two?.Do we need the Lost Lagoon?.But what else does he really need to do right now.Yeah.Um.Actually I should flip Cliffs of Abandon, considering--.Yeah why don't you fly, oh nevermind. I'm the(--) only person who knows. Yeah you could fly.here. Flip that one and that one.I mean he could just go there.(--).Oh yeah.But being in a helicopter is cool though so I flew.Two.Three.Okay.Nice.Nice.Golden Gate.Whispering Garden.Golden Gate's gone.Whispering Garden.Okay.So.So.I can flip that one back over.Can you get--you should--.Can you.wait no that's me.Nevermind.Oh that is you.Um.Oh I'm right here.Yeah she's green.We can move diagonal here and flip that.Yeah, do that.One, two.I think but you should also give her this.So then I just gotta have one.Yeah.Mhhm.One.Shore me up.Oh no.No.Well that'd be four moves then.Yeah.So.Well still move there, flip that, and then give her the card as your third.flip it.I can't.She has to be on the same tile.Well no I have to--.I can be on a different tile.Oh oh oh oh.Um.I can move to your tile.You can come to my tile.Yeah.Hm.Cause then you'll still be on my tile when it's--.Let's--but you can use your sand--you're always given a sandbag.Mhhm.Um--.But it's early in the game.Right.And if we lose this--.I would--she she should move here. Then we have somebody over here just in case something happens.And she's still somewhat close but she she can move diagonally.Right.So you're saying stay at Cliffs of Abandon?.Or she should move here. That way if something happens over here she's at least close by. (--) she's still kinda close by.Oh Twilight Hollow.And I can still move to you, one.So we're not trying to give her the card?.Wait.I can still go to her next turn.That's--.Yeah I wouldn't.Okay.Is that good?.Yeah, no.Do I need to go back then?.Did you flip, oh you flipped me you flipped me. Okay.I flipped it.Oh good.And two flood cards.Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate.Okay.Alright.Hm.Do you wanna give her that card?.This one?.I could do it.I mean.I'm trying to think.Oh no you're red. I can't remember.We should try to keep you close to these three so you can flip two cards at once.Also you can maybe be the one who's going to do the fire.Yeah.Mhm.So what if I just go.I should try to do this thing because I can fly back to you guys close so I can (--) so it's kinda out of the way.So.I could just move--.I think Explorer should do.the Lion. She has two already.Mhm.Okay hm.And you can use the helicopter card to fly her.Okay.And give it.to uh Whispering Garden.So should I just move here so I could always.(--).Mhhm.Whatever you do.Should you.Yeah that's good.I'm just trying to think if I should--.Shore up.Should you shore up?.Shore up what?.That card or no.Hm.Well eh.Like what if I go here.here just so I can give you this.rather than.just keep carrying in.I mean we both have one so like you don't know if.Oh.Yeah I'm gonna draw one or.Who's gonna get the next one?.Yeah.You know Pilot will draw two or something.But you know also give the cards back to her from anywhere.Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.Yeah, wherever I am.Okay.Oh yeah.If like she were to draw two just now, you could.That's fine.One.One action.two.Two action.three.Three.I'm really sorry guys.Okay.I feel like it's on purpose.We'll probably all lose that. Temple of the Moon.Oh I forgot that one was there.But if we lose the other thing, the other two don't matter.Three.Right.One.two.three.Temple's of the Moon, Breaker's Bridge.Temple of the Moon.Breaker's Bridge.and Cliff's of Abandon.Okay.Alright so,.I.I'm gonna.stay where I am or.make my way to Temple of the Sun.so I can cash these in.Oh.Oh.Eventually.Hopefully.I feel like we should shore that up.Which one?.Yeah you could shore.this up and then--.Shore that up and then move there.Breaker's Bridge.Either way you're in you're in you're in--.Shore both of them and then just move one.I mean you're in the middle (that we can move you close).Yeah.Okay.Because you have two of each.So one.Hm.Two.No shore that up first.One, two.Oh oh one two--.and then just move there.Then move--.Perfect.There we go.Good. Alright.Sandbags.and this.Good.Nice.You have to discard. Sorry.Oh yeah.One two, one two.Just use a sandbag on something.I mean she still has to discard.I have to I still have to get rid of it.You have to discard two.Oh.Should I get rid of.You're the only one that--.Probably.One of these.Well can you--.You're the only one with a chalice.Yeah they can't till their turn.Yeah.Aw.We're thinking.I mean I.wouldn't give up this one and I shouldn't.I have three of these so.Right. So you have too.Which one should we flip over.So we can use the sandbag.Yeah you don't have to cause it doesn't count as a turn. Why don't you just discard it.Right.Can we even use it?.But I--.Can we use that sandbag?.No because I drew it.You have to yeah you have to--.And I'd have to discard it cause I can only have five.Okay.Yeah so we can't use it. Okay.So we're.So I--.Yeah.So we're done.Well, yeah we don't need.So--.Do we need to do the floods?.Hm--.Yup.Lost Lagoon,.Iron Gate.Nice.Whispering Garden.Mh hm.That's--.Iron Gate? No.Nope.Lost Lagoon.Okay.Pilot.So--.They'll probably get this one.We should give her this card.Mhm.Oh yeah.But you have to be on the same spot as me.Oh okay.Who are--Oh you could no--.How close are you.I think you should move one,.shore up that.I'm going to move here. No I can't move there.Well you can, no yeah you could fly.Well you can fly.Alright.Okay, fly there.And that's your move.Give her the card and move here.But I can't shore that up though.Oh right.What.if.you.you gave me the card.Oh wait.We'd have to be relying on this getting shored up.Cause then you could give me two when you move to me.What if--.He's on the same spot as you right now, right?.He gives you.Both cards.either one cause I can give you this or I can give you this.Or you could give her both.I can give you both.and then.And then move but you still can't shore it up. You can only give her one card.So it'd be--.I would say just fly and give her the card and--.Why can't you just, no you can't sandbag them.(--) we could rescue it.Cause then.Could rescue--.But then someone else gets three turns too so.Explorer could.move over,.shore up,.and then cash in.Just have to hope that we didn't get a flood.For a.I could--.But still see people are closer to this. It really wouldn't, we could rescue it.Mhm.Okay.Right.So--.Just.So actually, we can save and bag this.I can give you these two cards, I can even move here.That way if it happens, I'm there.Mhm.It's like at some point, I don't go that whole round but.Yeah.I think, that's how you should do it.Shit.Give me this one, right?.So one,.I can give you this.Yeah.two.Two.and then--.Fly there--.three.Just move there just in case or should I, does it matter?.I don't think it really matters.Yeah.Okay.Cause it's--.Move--.Um.Wait hold hold on.I have exactly five now.Okay.Just saying.Oh oh yeah.Can you just--.No you can't give it to her. Okay.Alright.Wait wait.I can give, why can't I can't give one to her.Well she needs a sandbag card and I can give her one.Yeah.Then we don't lose the piece.Yeah I think that would be better.Use this.Yeah just use that to save him.and then instead.To save the Whispering Garden.Then give her the fi--give her the fire one cause you'll get you'll get these ones.Oh yeah well doesn't matter.Oh I think I should get the fire.I could give you either.Oh wait I thought you meant I thought you meant I use this and lion goes to the Explorer.Oh.(You use--).No cause I'm on the c--.Oh you have to be on the same thing as.Mhm.the person.Anyways who you give it to.So I thought it was.Oh yeah.you.Pilot fly to Twilight hollow is one,.give the card to Explorer two.and then if I just use this it doesn't count as a move for you but I would.Whispering Garden would be safe.Okay,.I like that.For (--) but she can't--giving three cards counts as three actions.Oh you're giving three cards?.Or she's gonna have to give her three cards.Cause--.She just has to give me this.She--so she can't move. Oh.I could just give her that.For once we're trying to get near--.And then I can get this one.out of the way.And then wait you could--cause you would go here--.Oh no.This is so hard.I got--.We're thinking too much this game.I know.Are we still on your turn right now? Okay. And this is where you originally were.Yeah I still I still have a move I still.Okay let's move one at a time.yeah so I have I have one action still.I think.So you,.you should--.all you did was give two cards that's--okay.I should I should take one of those.back.I would take lion back.Then she could she could still give me those. She could give me those two. Keep the fire one give me the lion back.and.I don't know.I got an idea. Okay.Okay. You just you go for it right now.Do you wanna do another.Cause then and then she (--).move.I say fly.to Twilight Hollow.give her the lion card.so she has three.and then.Then she can give her cards to.yeah. Cause then.if I use this, Whispering Garden's.safe.Hm. Okay.And that's three moves.Right.Are we are we using that now?.I can play it anytime.Yeah.You--.Hm--.Wait can you play it once I pick up a water card. Like I pick the card up can we use it?.I don't--I feel like no.Hmmh.I don't think so but I am also I'm just as close.Yeah yeah.So I should use it?.Well yeah.So we have that still. Okay (--) okay.Sure. Save it? Okay.Okay just save the sandbag.But then wait sorry.But like isn't more important for you to pick up treasures right now? So like.I guess you can discard the sandbag at any time but why not use it.Mhm.when we could use it.Does that make any sense?.Well she but she's not picking up like cards for a while. She can use it until your turn.Yeah I have--.Yeah we can we can wait until your turn wait yeah.We can wait.Mhm.Alright so we're good?.Yeah.I think so.That's a long time.Nice.Okay. Three of those.Hm there goes that.Uh!.But she can still use it before it's my turn.Forest and the Copper Gate. Where is that at.Okay.Alright.Okay.Alright.I am going to.Go to me.right?.go to you.And get rid of fire.Yeah.That's two.And then you can shore up.And I can still shore up this.Mhm that's three.Okay.We're still at 30.Two of those pieces don't matter so.Mhm.Copper Gate, Breaker's Bridge, Cliff's of Abandon.Okay.Which one did you get rid of?.Copper Gate.Alright.So now.I'll go here.Mhm.Yay.Discard those.Okay and.I'm on the same one.You oh.As me but what does it--.No before you move before you moved you should've gave her that card.Okay.So could we (--) that.So we're just gonna.Keep the take the--.reverse and I'm at.two actions now.So we yeah.I've had two actions so I have one more.Yeah.So you gave her the card before you moved, you moved there was two, and collecting the treasure was three.Three.Okay.Good.Okay cool.No.Why?.Oh.It's you this time.Discard the fire.Oh yeah that's what we just got.Okay.Now you pick two cards.All I need to flood.And then draw those, sorry.Sorry (--) turn.Whispering Garden.You need one more.And Crimson.Alright.Crimson Forest.Crimson Forest.and Howling Garden is gone.Oh.So.I need to make it there before it--.Somebody--.I would say it's pretty vital to sandbag.Retweet.Unless she can get there.No or or you can fly her there.I was gonna say--.Oh yeah.Wait wait wait I was gonna say I have three of these.I should go here.to get.your.Earth.Mhm.Nice.and then you can use one of those to fly me here.And then I collect.Would it--.That's my three moves.Wait.Move,.And use the sandbag at any time so it's fine.get--.Yeah.Wait can I give you a piece?.No I I would--.Can you give me--oh no you can't give me unless.Yeah.if you're on the same.thing as her.But I it's not my turn.It'd be her turn giving me the card.Alright point.That's a good point.Um.so--.Somehow we have to.Yeah this is important.Aw man.I would say.We still we still have three helicopter thingies.Yeah.Yeah I don't think there's anything you can do right now.Well I can move to Coral Palace and then flip.other than--.We should we should fly her there and have her turn this one and this one over.those.Mhm.And then just.be here.Yeah.so then we don't have to use a turn later.Mhm.Yeah so so fly fly--.Well she can't--.Okay.Oh.I'm flying you to here.That--.And--.So she needs a turn yet right? That doesn't count as a turn?.And that doesn't count as--.And then.I could use all three to boom boom boom.Yeah.Yeah.Are you going to move here though?.She can't. She can't move diagonally.Oh well then.no yeah I can't even move.Unless you flew her here.And she flipped this one over.And this one.She can't do it that's di--that's diagonal you can't do that one.Wait.so if we're here.But like if you flew her here.free--.Mhm.One,.Flip flip move.two,.move three.Yeah.Yeah leave--.So I mean Breaker's Bridge but--.Which is fine. Okay.Okay.Yeah.Sweet.No. Not sweet.Oh. Damn. Okay so I'll just discard them.Oh not sweet.No keep those cause I'll give you these two.Well I have five.But she can't she has too many cards.Oh yeah.Okay.Move the sandbag.Well look we already have this this.Get rid of the rock. I have a rock and she has a rock thing.Yeah.So get rid of two or get rid of.I would say just get rid of these cause we don't have to worry about that one we have the we have the two.Oh yeah.Back to square one where I was yeah.Okay.Yeah okay.Alright now the flood.Dunes of Deception.Silver Gate.and Cave of Embers.Nice.Okay.That one really doesn't matter.Okay.Okay.So now it's your turn.Somehow you have to give her.You should give her this.Mhm.I think.Mhm.And then she--.Are you on the same spot as her?.You're not on my space.Why don't you just use the sandbag? No.What?.Nothing just--.You--.Unless you just went one two, give me the card, three.He can fly himself there.Yeah fly yourself.Yeah.to her, give her the card.Fly myself here.Yeah give her that card.Give her this card.And either.shore up or move somewhere.One two three four five then I have six cards.Unless you want to move to--.Yeah so why don't you use the sandbag.What if what if I use this helicopter to fly her already on the space cause I have an extra one.Well she has six right now so just use the sandbag.Oh right.Why. Wait we have a situation.Oh I see what you're saying.I just.use the sandbag.Get rid just get rid of this.I would have to discard it though. I don't think it would--.Oh yeah.Just get rid, we already have enough.Okay.So I just used one two, I have one more.You either shore up or move.I'll just shore this up since.Or should he move to Fool's Landing?.Oh you should move her here.Why not?.I guess you can do it anytime.Yeah.Okay.Should I shore this up since I'm there.Yeah.Okay.Okay.So I.need to come here.Mhm.Mhm.One.Oh wait.No?.No she's no she's gonna--Point to us.Oh I didn't I didn't.Oh.You need to draw the flood levels.Oh.I see.(Yes we had something).Getting too ambitious.I think we need three.(--) one more.Oh.We can't count either.So Bronze Gate.This flip this.Right at the Gate over there.Bronze Gate?.Yeah and Coral Palace.Okay.Oo.It's (--).It's fine I'll just fix it.Okay you'll just fix it.Okay.So you should move here.One.Take your prize.My prize.Two.Um shore--.Yeah shore this up.Yeah.Mhm.Yup and then that's it.You don't need this right?.No I have four.Okay.Okay.Okay so we're pretty good.Nice.Um.Misty Marsh.Temple of the Sun.Watch Tower.Okay.So.We need that.I'm going to.do two adjacent tiles at the same time since we need Fool's Landing.So that's one.Two.Mhm.Um.and I don't think that I really should do anything else.But I'd move here.I moved to Fool--.Oh yeah. Fool's Landing.Fool's Landing. One.One.Well that was two, three.Two.Yeah. You're good.Yeah it's okay.Yeah okay.Nice idea.Oh my gosh.Can't--.Okay we're still at three.At least we got another helicopter in case we get a water card.Mhm.At least it's not gonna be Fool's Landing that we kick out.Temple of the Sun.My goodness.Misty Marsh.And Dunes of Deception.Okay.Alright.Alright.Alright.So I'm just gonna go.One two collect.One two--.One two.Fly her. Fly her. Just let's fly.collect.Well oh yeah I'm gonna fly you there.Why.Cause it's a free move I guess.Free move.Yeah we have it we have it.But what if we need to fly people here.I have two cards.And he can fly himself.And I can fly myself.Hm.But we still need one to fly out.Why don't--.That's true. Okay.I mean either I mean I guess it doesn't matter either way cause you're gonna have to come back up.Hm.Yeah.I mean one two collect is three moves so I can just do that.Well one two collect.you're good. Yeah that's a good point.Then--.Should we try--.Can we just fly people now or are we not--.Should we wait for his turn?.It doesn't count as an action so.We can fly you here.You have to be flown cause you're--.You here.Two.Does she have a card right.Mhm.Mhm.And we didn't solve one left by my turn I'll just fly myself there and we'll leave.Yeah.Wait so you just flew two people.and that's you.Yeah that's one.Yeah.Yeah.Okay.Nice.So I can even just move there.So--.You need to pick up your water cards.Oh yeah.Well she has to do that.I have to still do these and then those.You didn't do this. (--).Oh wow.So yeah. It doesn't matter.One.Silver Gate, Breaker's Bridge, Cliff's of Abandon.Silver Gate.Cliffs of Abandon, Breaker's Bridge is fine.My turn.Now fly yourself and fly us out.Fly us here and fly us out.Okay.Here we go.We beat it by a little bit.Two minutes.We definitely over thunk that.Yeah.My one turn lasted like four minutes though.

Ok.Oh yeah- I did not.And then these go face down.And then take two of 'em.And take two of them, correct?.Cliffs of Abandon and Whispering Garden.Oh gee.Good save, that one would've been gone. And uh-.Cliffs-.Cliffs-.Right next to it.Next to it, nice- oh wow, ok. I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence.Whoops.Oh look at it.Wreckin' the joint.Alright.Ok.None of this is a coincidence, Engineer.Yeah.Ok, so-.This is getting existential.Mm.The (cards) are stacked against us.I think that-.I should-.Should I mo-.And then flip and flip?.Move and save me?.As my actions.Yeah, because we're not at the point where-.Or do we want to start to give her a card?.(So) that we can just go straight for the chalice?.I can do that. I can flip-.What i-.I- I should flip.Oh definitely.What- what- what- what- what if you move, flip, card?.But-.Move the card, flip-.And then, maybe-.So that's-.One.That's one.One.Right.So-.And then, you can flip from there, right?.Right.Maybe two-.Two.And then let's see.Because you're so close to this-.That's why-.Oh.Oops.Yeah.Oh, for some reason I thought that- but you're still close to this too and you can move diagonally so whew.Should I just mo-.More towards the center?.I think so, too. Just move where all the action is.Yeah.Yeah.'Cause over here, like, there's not that much goin' on.Yeah.Ok.Yeah.And then-.Sandbag, yes.Ok.And-.The sandbag is really useful, actually.Two-.Breaker's Bridge-.And Phantom Rock.Phantom Rock, done..Alright.Great.Do we have to draw another one because of tha? Or is that-.Oh.No, because it's the first time that it's going out.Oh, that was the first time. Right right right right right- gotcha.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.So-.What do I wanna do?.Mm where you at?.Where's your- oh, there's your dude.Where are you?.I'm right here.I'm at the helicopt pad.Oh.Of course.Um-.That's where pilots are.(yeah).We don't have enough cards to do anything yet so I think we should still just focus on flipping things over so we don't lose pieces of the island.So-.(Now).I think I definitely need to get this guy.Yeah.Fly- yeah, fly here or move here-.Yeah.Fly-.And flip.So one, two-.And then-.Um.I think you're ok. I wonder if, like, last time we were-.So focused on using every action that-.Spending too much time-.Getting the three.Like in a situation like this, I don't know that- that there's a whole lot to be gained from it.Yeah.Ok, go ahead.Cool. Alright, let's just flip.Yeah, another helicopter lift and a fire.Woah.I need to get you that fire at some point.Mm.Let's do.Uh, I need two of those-.Lost Lagoon and Gold Gate..Gold Gate, buh-bye..And Lost Lagoon-.Lost Lagoon- it looks like a-.Lagoon with a-.Right here, it's gone..(Oh).Great.Ok, Explorer.Alright.Nice.Ok.You got this.Green.Ok.Um.I'm not sure I see any advantage to moving.But I could do-.Two-.Get those in one spot.The only thing is you're so close already.To that, I wonder if we should think about trying to get-.Oh- right, right right.Since you can give stuff.Yeah, yeah.Since I can give away?.Right.You can get from anywhere so it's almost like you just want to (pull) and see what you get.S-.So should I just move up here just to be safe?.Why don't- why don't you move-.Yeah.Or, well- eh I was thinking if you moved-.'Cause I can keep-.Here it's be closer to one of us if we-.Get another of the- whatever this thing is..Ok.And then you could-.I think that sounds good.Because you- you would- you're- you can move more easily than us.Or I could just go to the same-.I think that would be ok since neither of them is flooded yet.Yeah.We can- we can congregate.Ok.'Cause I'm thinking about also like, the transfer. 'Cause, we have to be on the same tile as you to transfer.So you can give me that-.That-.Lion though, while you're there.Oh yeah.Yeah, why not?.Why not?.'Cause I only just made the one move.Mmhmm.So there's that one-.Cool, I think-.'Kay.Ok, and then-.Ready do your-.Two-.Ooh, look at that.Hey.Couple more gifts to be made.That's right.And now I need to do two cards.Yep.'Kay- Temple of the Moon-.Iron Gate-.Which gate?.(This) Iron- is that-.Iron Gate.Is that gone- oh!.Right here.Gone.Ok.There we go.Alright.And then we're back to you.Right. So I'm thinking-.So-.Save this guy-.Oh we need to save this.Think I'm more than one- well, can I get there in time?.One, two-.One, two- you could-.Three-.One, two and then-.I could- well I could one, two at it then-.'Cause it's adjacent, right?.Yeah.Yeah.So that's one, two, flip.That's-.That's all you got.That's your three.Yep.I just feel like we need to save it 'cause it's got a treasure.That's right.Mmhmm.That's why I think we gotta prioritize it.Oh, you guys are gonna love this. Waters rise-.Oh no.Flood?.We are now up to three.Ugh.So, (take)-.Cool.Pick your three.Pick that- ope, thank you.Shuffle these bad boys-.Put them-.Uh oh, I think we're gonna lose-.Breaker's Bridge..We might.And then-.Two-.Tree-.We don't need it though. It's not really a treasure.Yeah, they're not- they're not urgent.Uh, Iron Gate- Cliffs of Abandon-.Buh-bye..Throw away are there.Is cliffs-.And then Temple of the Moon-.Alright, so good call on-.Flippin' that 'cause that would've been sunk.'Kay-.That's right..Yep.Ok, so I'm up.You are up.So-.We need to get-.We need to f-.Yeah, where- I'm the gray one so I can-.Flip this-.Oh.That one's not gone yet.So I'm here so I can flip-.Yeah.Because I think if we don't-.Good call..(--).Yeah, flip-.So-.Oh, Cliffs of Abandon isn't gone eiher?.We don't want that one to go away..No.That's the one I just flippe back over.Ok.Yeah, we only lost the one for good.So, that was one-.(Of) two..And-.I think-.You moved and then flipped, right?.I didn't move, I only flipped..Oh, ok.Give-.Oh that's right. You're on it. Yeah yeah yeah yeah-.Give her the- this guy.Yeah.Let's get you the-.Two-.Thing.And then-.Should I-.Shore up?.Should you sandbag on this guy?.Yeah, why not.I think so..Yeah.I think we should use it.Because-.If our next steps are trying to get you-.(--).Yeah, we are puttin'-.All of our eggs in one basket, I guess.Oh look I got another one- look I got another one so-.We're putting-.Great..Oh good.Oh good, yeah. Good.Good good.Great, whew!.Ok.I was just thinking-.I thought one of us would probably be able to get there-.But, this is-.Alright.The risk averse action, so that's fine.S-.So, you know what I can do right now? I can move you.So that you're there.Ah!.Is that premature because you don't have the last-.Is that-.I don't have the last one..Chalice thing?.Yeah, we should-.Wait a second, let's wait..Why don't we wait on that until we can get her a fourth one, 'cause you could draw it, you n-.Ok.What do we have to-.So I got Whispering Garden-.Howling Garden-.Ooh, ooh..And Breaker's Bridge.Is gone.Oh.'Kay.So both the lion ones are flipped, so we need to save those.Yeah, we need to prioritize that.You're up..So I can do that now. I can flip one of those.'Cause I'm right here.Mmhmm.I'll just flip this one back over.So- oop.One-.And we have to be careful because, like-.You're ability to move is now-.For everybody is-.Mmhmm.Yeah, but I can fly.(--).That's true.Well aren't you special.Why don't I fly here and flip this one?.Ok.Sure, what the heck.Two-.Three. Ok..Three..'Cause then I'll just-.Then we'll just keep our options open.Yeah.Mm.Alright.Can I do that?.Check my pawn.Oh, was it-.(Did you) grab the wrong one? You grabbed the wrong one.Oh.Oh, opps. Oops.Whoop.Sorry.Yeah, so- fly. Yeah.Ok.Oh, I got one of these.Holler.Ooh.And now you have too many cards, right?.Now I have too many cards, so which one should I drop?.Wait, how many do you have?.Do these count?.I had five before.These count.Oh you got du- you gotta dump both of 'em.Oh, foo-.But, I should keep this in case I want to give it to you.Yeah.I have mine too though, but my- my turn'll be before yours is.Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna drop that one-.Yep.And we're not really goin' for the chalice, right?.Not, right now. I'd dump that one too.Alright.Cool, let's get three of those bad boys.Yep.Oop.Whoops, there we are.So-.Does it really matters-.Crimson Forest-.Whoo.One.Cave of-.Embers.Two.We can keep to th-.Copper Gate.Outskirts would be lovely.Three.Ok.Great.Ok, so-.Alright.We need to get you to the- one of the temple- well- we need to get you here. So-.I can do that.Alright, so-.Wa- and it's not even gonna count.How about-.Though, I move-.Here, 'cause I can go diagonally.You can go diagonally, yeah.Mmhmm.And then I can flip-.So that's two..And then move diagonally again?.To get on the-.Thing.Or, I can keep this and save you a move.How about I move to another one- oh, that'll- that won't make a difference.I don't think- yeah, there's nothing to be gained.Alright, well let's hold on to that 'cause I'm right here.Yeah, you can go there anyway.Ok.Yeah.Ok.And we'll save it for another-.Rainy day.Yeah.Ok, and then- you're gonna have to get rid of-.Cards too, so-.Too.Oh, crap.Dun dun dun.Alright.(And)-.Oh, the good news is we're still the three r- we're still in the tree range.That-.Yeah.So-.So-.You have too many right now so I think you should get rid of-.Yeah.Yep.I have two of these-.I would-.(Eh).Get rid of the fire.Right?.'Cause- eh- we'll still have four floating around in case we're like-.Do we have enough? Yeah, we do have enough.Yeah.So, now we need three.You need to swap that.Ok.Aye.No more of these.But all the important ones are not-.At risk right now.Whispering Garden.(--).For the most part-.Temple of the Moon.S- this one.Up that one.The one you're on.Don't worry, you're next, you can flip her.And Copper Gate.Yeah, we're good.Wow.Ok.Ok, so-.So-.We obviously gotta save this.Obviously-.You can stay there and flip it.I can, I can.Yeah-.You can flip at once, right? So can you flip that one too?.Right.(Wha-).So do this one, yeah.I can do this one as well.Two-.And then, um-.Put her back.Put her back there.Yeah.And then- oh no, this is kind of a s-.And then-.So that was only one.Yes, technically..Um, you wan- you wanna flip this one?.So-.So what are you looking for?.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Do I have the lion ready? So I'll just move here, flip this one-.Yeah.And then that'll be your-.That's your three.That's your three.Right.And that's good, too 'cause then I'm kind of in the neighborhood- for flipping.Alright, helicopter lift and another lion so we're-.We have too many.We're not going for the chalice right now, right? Ok, so we'll just kind of put that one out.So we have to get rid of one.Yeah.Yeah.Thank you very much. And then I have three of these.Alright, Crimson Forest-.Is that one-.Out already- oh wait, it's up here.Calling Crimson Forest, oh wow.We're at twenty-three minutes by the way.Oh.Ok.It is out, uh, Cave of Embers.There's another one gone.Right here.Buh-bye.That's gone as well and then Cliffs of Abandon right here in the middle.Oh crap.Oh.So Cliffs of Abandon we keep.Oops.Yep, and this.Correct.Yeah, those go away.Yeah.(Let's) go.Yeah.So we got rid of one of the fire ones so we need to guard this with our lives.Oh, was one of them a fire one?.If we want to be able to get that one, yeah.Yeah.Oh.Good call.Ok.Good call.(--).My turb.Yeah.Ok, so-.You want to get that over to her.One-.Flip.Two-.And you wanna just start workin'-.I can fly you somewhere.Um, does it make sense for me to go anywhere?.Any- would it be useful to camp you out on the fire card in case it-.And then you can flip.Flip (once) and then-.Ok.You still have one more.No, that was three. 'Cause I gave up my card, I flipped-.And then she flew you-.One, two-.And then you flew me.But again, I don't- I don't-.No-.It's not a move.Oh, that's not move?.Right.Well, that's ok.'Cause there's not really anything else to do.I- I don't think there's nothing- yeah, there's nothing else to do.Yeah, you don't have to.Ok, cool.Ok.Oh.You may only have five cards in your hand.I only have two.Oh, you have six.(--).Oh, shoot!.Oh.Oh, that's right. So you have to discard one.Uh-.Let's get rid of one of 'em.Um.Let's get rid of fire.Well we already have four lions.We have-.Yeah, we already have four lions. Get rid of your lion one.Yeah.Ok.And then I'll hang out. I'll try and stay hangin' out over here.Yeah.Yeah.In this area.Ok, cool.Ooh.And then I'll come and fly to you and give-.Oof.Hey, look at that!.Ooo.Ooo.Ok, and then-.Good draw.Three.Do not be-.Dunes of Deception-.Silver Gate.And Howling Garden.(--).Ok.Ok, Pilot.So-.I need to fly near you and give you these two cards.Right?.And you're next to this one.'Cause you- yeah, right. 'Cause you can't give them to me-.So-.One-.First, could you flipped this though?.I think we should-.Just wait-.Let this one die-.So that we can protect this one-.'Cause we have-.We have a good lock on this one (huh).Ok.'Cause then I can do two, three.Ok.Alright, and then I gotta get rid of one of these or-.Well, we'll be more-.(What'd-).Any reason for me-.You have to get rid of two, we can only have five.Right.And then, we should move off of this.Right.In case this guy comes up next.Right.So should I use my helicopter?.So should I-.How about you use his?.Or you use yours 'cause you have a lot of cards.You use-.I think- yeah, yeah, yeah.But-.So that'll get rid of one-.Right, but I have to-.Can I use this or is that-.Just discard this?.Oh, you have to discard it.But you can use it at any time.Right.But it sh-.Do I-.Need to dump these two first then? Ok.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, you need to get rid of-.Yeah yeah.Ok.Yeah, so yeah.That's fine, so-.Just get rid of those.That's fine, fire's one we're not doing now. And then- and then-.And then fly-.Fly us there.Here?.I'll just fly over here- both of us, over there.Both of us, 'cause we're on the same tile.Ok.Good call.And then this goes in-.So I got two of these comin'.Alright.Ok.Now we need three of those.I only (have) four cards right now, and I can still fly.Keep that on our radar.'Kay.Tidal Palace-.Bronze Gate-.And coral-.And Coral Palace.Here.'Kay.Right, we're at twenty minutes so-.Yeah, if we- we're good.Right, so (I)-.Ok, so you-.My turn?.Great, we have to do that one first.Yes, so let's get our-.Alright, so get rid of that.So that's one.Bring it.Ok, now I'm going to-.Going to.Flip-.This so that you guys aren't landlocked.I think-.I can only-.I can only move one that's adjacent.And I can do diagonal.But you'll be able to flip this-.Yeah-.Yeah.P- Assuming that I- that neither of us draw it.So-.Let's see-.We can't assume taht right now.You could move this way and then flip that one.I could-.That- yeah.To keep our options open? I like that, yeah.Yeah.That's a good idea, 'cause that's-.Ok.Yep.If we lose- if we lose this one we're gonna have to keep a path for you to get over there.We don't wanna (you) lose both.Two, three.So that's-.Two, so I'm- I'm done.Yeah.For that.Yeah.So-.'Kay.Alright, and the- the fires are comin' back so we-.That was a good choice to throw them away guys.Alright.Yeah.Now- three.Oh, please don't be one in the middle.(Hah).Watchtower-.Ok.Misty Marsh.One-.Temple of the Sun.Ok, we can- we can do that.(Right) here.Ok.Not too bad.Well, 'cause we don't need this one anymore, technically.Not- not really, no.Yeah, we can ditch both of those if we have to.Ok, so-.Mm 'kay.Your turn?.Alright, we're gonna start flooding soon.Right.Yeah.Like, statistically speaking, that's gonna be happening.We should-.So-.We gotta do taht one.Yeah.Do that one, yep.I.Yep.I (gave it)-.Eh.So now we've got two, of the three.So that's one-.S-.We have eighteen minutes guys.So that's one move-.Not bad.That's not bad, we're less than half- I- I mean, more than half-.Just so we know.Ok.So one-.Less than half.One move, we have two.Alright, but let's think for a second. Which-.You need to flip this 'cause you can do that diagonally.No I can't.He can flip two anyway.I can flip two but I can't do them diagonally.Oh, you cannot do them diagonally.Right.So-.So, that was one, I could move over here though. And flip these two.And then flip.Two and then three.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Let's do that.Why not?.Let's keep a nice pathway.So you're done with your three moves.'Cause you-.You re-.Yes, yes, yes. And then let's start thinking, which of the remaining two-.Trieved.Makes sense to go after. We got three-.So for my action, I could give you-.All three of my cards if you can get yourself-.To-.I can- I can do that right now.One of those.Well with- let's finish with- he needs-.Did you draw?.Oh, that's true. let me finish the turn yet.Yeah.Yeah, yeah the flooding.Or, you did that.Oh.'Cause that might help us with the decisions.(Right).No.Oh, crap.Water rise, but we also got a fly.So-.Yes.Ok.Right, and we're still only at-.We're still only on three.Still only on three.Ok, so-.That's right.Thank you Messenger.You're welcome.And our two ones that we need are also not-.And they- they have someone standing by to flip them.In danger right now.Mmhmm.To shore them up.Use the verbage.We're gettin' close. What's our next one that we're going after?.Alright.That's what I was tr-.The chalice.Tryin' to thnk of.Yeah.Yeah.Ok, so-.The chalice I guess, ha- we have more options with the chalice. But let's see where we are.We have Dunes of Deception-.Is gone-.Ok.'Kay-.Misty Marsh-.Flip that guy.And Bronze Gate-.Is gone.Bronze Gate is gone.Ok.(Our island's getting smaller).And then- you're done, right?.Correct.Alright.Alright, so-.Can you give all three of those?.Yeah, one, two, three.That would be my three actions. I just wouldn't be able to do anything else.That's your three actions.Ok.(Yep).And then I'm gonna fly-.Myself.There to prep for it.Do you have to wait for your-.Turn?.No, this is play at anytime.Ok.So you wanna fly-.So even-.Over here?.Yeah.'Kay, and then you need to dump-.So-.Ok, so-.One, two, three, four, five. I'm gonna get rid of these.Mm.Right? That makes sense?.Yep.Yeah, 'cause that's already gone.Yep.Yep.We've already, captured that one.And then, even if-.Anything happens with this-.We still have this one on call so you can fly me there and then we can flip.And we have two people-.Yeah.Well-.Yeah, ready to go.Did we cheat?.(--).Oh, so we do have to keep one of those.Yeah, you used that.If you use it, you have to get rid of it.The- the lift, did you use it or was it just a regualr move?.No, she did move.Yeah, that was just.But it wasn't your turn so it would've been a special card.You're right, you're right.Yeah.It's not my turn yet, 'cause you still have to pull your these.So I just pulled these two and then I need three-.Ok.Flooded ones.Please don't be two Coral Palaces.Silver Gate-.Buh-bye.Uh oh.Ok.Hm.Watchtower-.Uh oh.And-.Whisper Garden- Whispering Garden.Ooh.Ok.And then I'm finished.Ok, so now I'm at this.We have our three.S-.Yeah.So that's one.Yeah, we're done.So we have our three treasures.But now we have to get off the island.Oh, true.Right, so now we need to all get to the-.Ok.So I'm just gonna-.Which we're all really close.That was one action.One-.Fly per turn to any tile. Ok, so I can only move myself so I'm just gonna move myself-.Here.Yeah.And just hang out.'Kay.And wait for us.And then we need to protect the chalice, still.Why.For-.No-.For you to get there.There's just like- we need to get- we need to make sure you have a path to get there.You mean all of us?.All of us do, yeah.Yeah.Or, we can try to have you guys cluster somewhere and then you-.Oh no.Yeah, well let's just see how the next-.You're right.You're right.Yeah.Couple turns go.I'm just saying, we're- even though we're not going after it anymore we need to be aware of it.Yeah, I was re-.Fifteen minute- I put a lot of my energy into getting these treasures. Were you guys thinking that too? We're like, let's get the treausres- ok..Yeah.Alright.So you need your two cards?.I'm (gonna) flip-.Yep.Chalice and a sandbag.S-.Oh good.Sandbags are good.Yes.Yeah.They are.You got one, too. We can use them at anytime.Counted.Yep.So if there's any risk of-.Any of these going anywhere, sandbag it.Right.Ok.So-.Did you-.Flood.And we need three of those.Now you need three.Right.(You) sound so anxious Engineer.Temple of the Sun, that's already gone, isn't it?.Down there.Oh ok.It is now.It is now.It is now.Now it is.Buh-bye.Temple of the Moon.Flip.And Howling Garden.That one I-.Right there.(--).Ok.Alright.Alright.My turn?.Explorer-.I think you gotta start moving toward the helicopter pad.Yep.Yeah.So I'm right here so I can move here-.One-.One-.Move again.Does anybo-.Two.Yeah.She just move again, yeah.Yeah.Move again.Just move one more time.There's nothing else to do.Ok.Cool.And I guess it doesn't really matter 'cause we already have so just-.Nope.You can keep one of them, how 'bout the fire?.Oh.And then flood.Alright and then the-.Three.Alright, Tidal Palace-.I wonder if I should've- oh, you know I should've-.That's alright, we don't need it.Yeah.Um, Cliffs of Abandon.That's alright, too.And Copper Gate.Can I-.Can we just-.Sandbag that guy?.Or I can flip it.Wa- yeah, 'cause it's your turn now.Right, ok.Right.Yeah.And you can still get there in time?.So-.Yeah.Ok.So (as) really all I need is this and then-.Two, three.One-.Yeah.So what we real-.And then, you gotta pick two.And then we just-.Yes, and we just need to- oh crap.Oh no.Ok.That's ok.Alright, we just need to protect the Coral Palace.Up to four.Oh boy.All the sandbags are going towards Coral Palace.Yeah.Twelve minutes.Well, thirteen.Uh.This game feels like it's going mch quicker.Temple of the Moon.Buh-bye.Cliffs of Abandon.'Kay.Whispering Garden.(--).Gone.And Misty Marsh.And then done, right?.Yep.Yep.So, one-.One-.Two-.Two-.Helicopter us right now.(Ta-).Woo.Don't

down?.Like.That's like-.I used to be an auditor. I can read anything upside down.Yeah.Oh you can anything. Oh look at this- that's great.Nice.I learned how to read off people's desks.That's convenient, yeah.It's like Messenger- Messenger- lucky Messenger over here.So we have the same-.I know I-.We have the same amount of time.I picked the right-.Yeah.Ok.(Timers report).Alirght.Thirty-five-.Ok.So-.So let's flip some cards-.Similar as before, let' take advantage of what I can flip.Yes.Mmhmm.Mmhmm.So, um-.Get that lion over.Ok.Mmhmm.So-.Move and then flip these two.Maybe flip-.Yeah.Mmhmm.Let's do that so-.And then can I flip the one I'm on as well as a separate action? Alright-.Mmhmm.Why don't we just do that?.Yeah.Maximize the colo.(Boom).Ok.Yeah, try to keep the ones in the middle.Yeah, for sure, ok.Alright, water rise.Thanks, Pilot. Waters- waters rise and a chalice.Mmhmm.Yeah, woo.So we're up to two.Um-.Oh these are already here. And then this goes-.And then get rid of that.(Yeah).Can you shuffe that bad boy?.And then this was- you didn't shuffle these yet, right? Ok.Oh yeah- I did not.And then these go face down.And then take two of 'em.And take two of them, correct?.Cliffs of Abandon and Whispering Garden.Oh gee.Good save, that one would've been gone. And uh-.Cliffs-.Cliffs-.Right next to it.Next to it, nice- oh wow, ok. I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence.Whoops.Oh look at it.Wreckin' the joint.Alright.Ok.None of this is a coincidence, Engineer.Yeah.Ok, so-.This is getting existential.Mm.The (cards) are stacked against us.I think that-.I should-.Should I mo-.And then flip and flip?.Move and save me?.As my actions.Yeah, because we're not at the point where-.Or do we want to start to give her a card?.(So) that we can just go straight for the chalice?.I can do that. I can flip-.What i-.I- I should flip.Oh definitely.What- what- what- what- what if you move, flip, card?.But-.Move the card, flip-.And then, maybe-.So that's-.One.That's one.One.Right.So-.And then, you can flip from there, right?.Right.Maybe two-.Two.And then let's see.Because you're so close to this-.That's why-.Oh.Oops.Yeah.Oh, for some reason I thought that- but you're still close to this too and you can move diagonally so whew.Should I just mo-.More towards the center?.I think so, too. Just move where all the action is.Yeah.Yeah.'Cause over here, like, there's not that much goin' on.Yeah.Ok.Yeah.And then-.Sandbag, yes.Ok.And-.The sandbag is really useful, actually.Two-.Breaker's Bridge-.And Phantom Rock.Phantom Rock, done.Alright.Great.Do we have to draw another one because of tha? Or is that-.Oh.No, because it's the first time that it's going out.Oh, that was the first time. Right right right right right- gotcha.Mmhmm.Yeah.Ok.So-.What do I wanna do?.Mm where you at?.Where's your- oh, there's your dude.Where are you?.I'm right here.I'm at the helicopt pad.Oh.Of course.Um-.That's where pilots are.(yeah).We don't have enough cards to do anything yet so I think we should still just focus on flipping things over so we don't lose pieces of the island.So-.(Now).I think I definitely need to get this guy.Yeah.Fly- yeah, fly here or move here-.Yeah.Fly-.And flip.So one, two-.And then-.Um.I think you're ok. I wonder if, like, last time we were-.So focused on using every action that-.Spending too much time-.Getting the three.Like in a situation like this, I don't know that- that there's a whole lot to be gained from it.Yeah.Ok, go ahead.Cool. Alright, let's just flip.Yeah, another helicopter lift and a fire.Woah.I need to get you that fire at some point.Mm.Let's do.Uh, I need two of those-.Lost Lagoon and Gold Gate.Gold Gate, buh-bye.And Lost Lagoon-.Lost Lagoon- it looks like a-.Lagoon with a-.Right here, it's gone.(Oh).Great.Ok, Explorer.Alright.Nice.Ok.You got this.Green.Ok.Um.I'm not sure I see any advantage to moving.But I could do-.Two-.Get those in one spot.The only thing is you're so close already.To that, I wonder if we should think about trying to get-.Oh- right, right right.Since you can give stuff.Yeah, yeah.Since I can give away?.Right.You can get from anywhere so it's almost like you just want to (pull) and see what you get.S-.So should I just move up here just to be safe?.Why don't- why don't you move-.Yeah.Or, well- eh I was thinking if you moved-.'Cause I can keep-.Here it's be closer to one of us if we-.Get another of the- whatever this thing is.Ok.And then you could-.I think that sounds good.Because you- you would- you're- you can move more easily than us.Or I could just go to the same-.I think that would be ok since neither of them is flooded yet.Yeah.We can- we can congregate.Ok.'Cause I'm thinking about also like, the transfer. 'Cause, we have to be on the same tile as you to transfer.So you can give me that-.That-.Lion though, while you're there.Oh yeah.Yeah, why not?.Why not?.'Cause I only just made the one move.Mmhmm.So there's that one-.Cool, I think-.'Kay.Ok, and then-.Ready do your-.Two-.Ooh, look at that.Hey.Couple more gifts to be made.That's right.And now I need to do two cards.Yep.'Kay- Temple of the Moon-.Iron Gate-.Which gate?.(This) Iron- is that-.Iron Gate.Is that gone- oh!.Right here.Gone.Ok.There we go.Alright.And then we're back to you.Right.

Waters rise-.Oh no.Flood?.We are now up to three.Ugh.So, (take)-.Cool.Pick your three.Pick that- ope, thank you.Shuffle these bad boys-.Put them-.Uh oh, I think we're gonna lose-.Breaker's Bridge.We might.And then-.Two-.Tree-.We don't need it though. It's not really a treasure.Yeah, they're not- they're not urgent.Uh, Iron Gate- Cliffs of Abandon-.Buh-bye.Throw away are there.Is cliffs-.And then Temple of the Moon-.Alright, so good call on-.Flippin' that 'cause that would've been sunk.'Kay-.That's right.Yep.Ok, so I'm up.You are up.So-.We need to get-.We need to f-.Yeah, where- I'm the gray one so I can-.Flip this-.Oh.That one's not gone yet.So I'm here so I can flip-.Yeah.Because I think if we don't-.Good call.(--).Yeah, flip-.So-.Oh, Cliffs of Abandon isn't gone eiher?.We don't want that one to go away.No.That's the one I just flippe back over.Ok.Yeah, we only lost the one for good.So, that was one-.(Of) two.And-.I think-.You moved and then flipped, right?.I didn't move, I only flipped.Oh, ok.Give-.Oh that's right. You're on it. Yeah yeah yeah yeah-.Give her the- this guy.Yeah.Let's get you the-.Two-.Thing.And then-.Should I-.Shore up?.Should you sandbag on this guy?.Yeah, why not.I think so.Yeah.I think we should use it.Because-.If our next steps are trying to get you-.(--).Yeah, we are puttin'-.All of our eggs in one basket, I guess.Oh look I got another one- look I got another one so-.We're putting-.Great.Oh good.Oh good, yeah. Good.Good good.Great, whew!.Ok.I was just thinking-.I thought one of us would probably be able to get there-.But, this is-.Alright.The risk averse action, so that's fine.S-.So, you know what I can do right now? I can move you.So that you're there.Ah!.Is that premature because you don't have the last-.Is that-.I don't have the last one.Chalice thing?.Yeah, we should-.Wait a second, let's wait.Why don't we wait on that until we can get her a fourth one, 'cause you could draw it, you n-.Ok.What do we have to-.So I got Whispering Garden-.Howling Garden-.Ooh, ooh.And Breaker's Bridge.Is gone.Oh.'Kay.So both the lion ones are flipped, so we need to save those.Yeah, we need to prioritize that.You're up.So I can do that now. I can flip one of those.'Cause I'm right here.Mmhmm.I'll just flip this one back over.So- oop.One-.And we have to be careful because, like-.You're ability to move is now-.For everybody is-.Mmhmm.Yeah, but I can fly.(--).That's true.Well aren't you special.Why don't I fly here and flip this one?.Ok.Sure, what the heck.Two-.Three. Ok.Three.'Cause then I'll just-.Then we'll just keep our options open.Yeah.Mm.Alright.Can I do that?.Check my pawn.Oh, was it-.(Did you) grab the wrong one? You grabbed the wrong one.Oh.Oh, opps. Oops.Whoop.Sorry.Yeah, so- fly. Yeah.Ok.Oh, I got one of these.Holler.Ooh.And now you have too many cards, right?.Now I have too many cards, so which one should I drop?.Wait, how many do you have?.Do these count?.I had five before.These count.Oh you got du- you gotta dump both of 'em.Oh, foo-.But, I should keep this in case I want to give it to you.Yeah.I have mine too though, but my- my turn'll be before yours is.Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna drop that one-.Yep.And we're not really goin' for the chalice, right?.Not, right now. I'd dump that one too.Alright.Cool, let's get three of those bad boys.Yep.Oop.Whoops, there we are.So-.Does it really matters-.Crimson Forest-.Whoo.One.Cave of-.Embers.Two.We can keep to th-.Copper Gate.Outskirts would be lovely.Three.Ok.Great.Ok, so-.Alright.We need to get you to the- one of the temple- well- we need to get you here. So-.I can do that.Alright, so-.Wa- and it's not even gonna count.How about-.Though, I move-.Here, 'cause I can go diagonally.You can go diagonally, yeah.Mmhmm.And then I can flip-.So that's two.And then move diagonally again?.To get on the-.Thing.Or, I can keep this and save you a move.How about I move to another one- oh, that'll- that won't make a difference.I don't think- yeah, there's nothing to be gained.Alright, well let's hold on to that 'cause I'm right here.Yeah, you can go there anyway.Ok.Yeah.Ok.And we'll save it for another-.Rainy day.Yeah.Ok, and then- you're gonna have to get rid of-.Cards too, so-.Too.Oh, crap.Dun dun dun.Alright.(And)-.Oh, the good news is we're still the three r- we're still in the tree range.That-.Yeah.So-.So-.You have too many right now so I think you should get rid of-.Yeah.Yep.I have two of these-.I would-.(Eh).Get rid of the fire.Right?.'Cause- eh- we'll still have four floating around in case we're like-.Do we have enough? Yeah, we do have enough.Yeah.So, now we need three.You need to swap that.Ok.Aye.No more of these.But all the important ones are not-.At risk right now.Whispering Garden.(--).For the most part-.Temple of the Moon.S- this one.Up that one.The one you're on.Don't worry, you're next, you can flip her.And Copper Gate.Yeah, we're good.Wow.Ok.Ok, so-.So-.We obviously gotta save this.Obviously-.You can stay there and flip it.I can, I can.Yeah-.You can flip at once, right? So can you flip that one too?.Right.(Wha-).So do this one, yeah.I can do this one as well.Two-.And then, um-.Put her back.Put her back there.Yeah.And then- oh no, this is kind of a s-.And then-.So that was only one.Yes, technically.Um, you wan- you wanna flip this one?.So-.So what are you looking for?.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Do I have the lion ready? So I'll just move here, flip this one-.Yeah.And then that'll be your-.That's your three.That's your three.Right.And that's good, too 'cause then I'm kind of in the neighborhood- for flipping.Alright, helicopter lift and another lion so we're-.We have too many.We're not going for the chalice right now, right? Ok, so we'll just kind of put that one out.So we have to get rid of one.Yeah.Yeah.Thank you very much. And then I have three of these.Alright, Crimson Forest-.Is that one-.Out already- oh wait, it's up here.Calling Crimson Forest, oh wow.We're at twenty-three minutes by the way.Oh.Ok.It is out, uh, Cave of Embers.There's another one gone.Right here.Buh-bye.That's gone as well and then Cliffs of Abandon right here in the middle.Oh crap.Oh.So Cliffs of Abandon we keep.Oops.Yep, and this.Correct.Yeah, those go away.Yeah.(Let's) go.Yeah.So we got rid of one of the fire ones so we need to guard this with our lives.Oh, was one of them a fire one?.If we want to be able to get that one, yeah.Yeah.Oh.Good call.Ok.Good call.(--).My turb.Yeah.Ok, so-.You want to get that over to her.One-.Flip.Two-.And you wanna just start workin'-.I can fly you somewhere.Um, does it make sense for me to go anywhere?.Any- would it be useful to camp you out on the fire card in case it-.And then you can flip.Flip (once) and then-.Ok.You still have one more.No, that was three. 'Cause I gave up my card, I flipped-.And then she flew you-.One, two-.And then you flew me.But again, I don't- I don't-.No-.It's not a move.Oh, that's not move?.Right.Well, that's ok.'Cause there's not really anything else to do.I- I don't think there's nothing- yeah, there's nothing else to do.Yeah, you don't have to.Ok, cool.Ok.Oh.You may only have five cards in your hand.I only have two.Oh, you have six.(--).Oh, shoot!.Oh.Oh, that's right. So you have to discard one.Uh-.Let's get rid of one of 'em.Um.Let's get rid of fire.Well we already have four lions.We have-.Yeah, we already have four lions. Get rid of your lion one.Yeah.Ok.And then I'll hang out. I'll try and stay hangin' out over here.Yeah.Yeah.In this area.Ok, cool.Ooh.And then I'll come and fly to you and give-.Oof.Hey, look at that!.Ooo.Ooo.Ok, and then-.Good draw.Three.Do not be-.Dunes of Deception-.Silver Gate.And Howling Garden.(--).Ok.Ok, Pilot.So-.I need to fly near you and give you these two cards.Right?.And you're next to this one.'Cause you- yeah, right. 'Cause you can't give them to me-.So-.One-.First, could you flipped this though?.I think we should-.Just wait-.Let this one die-.So that we can protect this one-.'Cause we have-.We have a good lock on this one (huh).Ok.'Cause then I can do two, three.Ok.Alright, and then I gotta get rid of one of these or-.Well, we'll be more-.(What'd-).Any reason for me-.You have to get rid of two, we can only have five.Right.And then, we should move off of this.Right.In case this guy comes up next.Right.So should I use my helicopter?.So should I-.How about you use his?.Or you use yours 'cause you have a lot of cards.You use-.I think- yeah, yeah, yeah.But-.So that'll get rid of one-.Right, but I have to-.Can I use this or is that-.Just discard this?.Oh, you have to discard it.But you can use it at any time.Right.But it sh-.Do I-.Need to dump these two first then? Ok.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, you need to get rid of-.Yeah yeah.Ok.Yeah, so yeah.That's fine, so-.Just get rid of those.That's fine, fire's one we're not doing now. And then- and then-.And then fly-.Fly us there.Here?.I'll just fly over here- both of us, over there.Both of us, 'cause we're on the same tile.Ok.Good call.And then this goes in-.So I got two of these comin'.Alright.Ok.Now we need three of those.I only (have) four cards right now, and I can still fly.Keep that on our radar.'Kay.Tidal Palace-.Bronze Gate-.And coral-.And Coral Palace.Here.'Kay.Right, we're at twenty minutes so-.Yeah, if we- we're good.Right, so (I)-.Ok, so you-.My turn?.Great, we have to do that one first.Yes, so let's get our-.Alright, so get rid of that.So that's one.Bring it.Ok, now I'm going to-.Going to.Flip-.This so that you guys aren't landlocked.I think-.I can only-.I can only move one that's adjacent.And I can do diagonal.But you'll be able to flip this-.Yeah-.Yeah.P- Assuming that I- that neither of us draw it.So-.Let's see-.We can't assume taht right now.You could move this way and then flip that one.I could-.That- yeah.To keep our options open? I like that, yeah.Yeah.That's a good idea, 'cause that's-.Ok.Yep.If we lose- if we lose this one we're gonna have to keep a path for you to get over there.We don't wanna (you) lose both.Two, three.So that's-.Two, so I'm- I'm done.Yeah.For that.Yeah.So-.'Kay.Alright, and the- the fires are comin' back so we-.That was a good choice to throw them away guys.Alright.Yeah.Now- three.Oh, please don't be one in the middle.(Hah).Watchtower-.Ok.Misty Marsh.One-.Temple of the Sun.Ok, we can- we can do that.(Right) here.Ok.Not too bad.Well, 'cause we don't need this one anymore, technically.Not- not really, no.Yeah, we can ditch both of those if we have to.Ok, so-.Mm 'kay.Your turn?.Alright, we're gonna start flooding soon.Right.Yeah.Like, statistically speaking, that's gonna be happening.We should-.So-.We gotta do taht one.Yeah.Do that one, yep.I.Yep.I (gave it)-.Eh.So now we've got two, of the three.So that's one-.S-.We have eighteen minutes guys.So that's one move-.Not bad.That's not bad, we're less than half- I- I mean, more than half-.Just so we know.Ok.So one-.Less than half.One move, we have two.Alright, but let's think for a second. Which-.You need to flip this 'cause you can do that diagonally.No I can't.He can flip two anyway.I can flip two but I can't do them diagonally.Oh, you cannot do them diagonally.Right.So-.So, that was one, I could move over here though. And flip these two.And then flip.Two and then three.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Let's do that.Why not?.Let's keep a nice pathway.So you're done with your three moves.'Cause you-.You re-.Yes, yes, yes. And then let's start thinking, which of the remaining two-.Trieved.Makes sense to go after. We got three-.So for my action, I could give you-.All three of my cards if you can get yourself-.To-.I can- I can do that right now.One of those.Well with- let's finish with- he needs-.Did you draw?.Oh, that's true. let me finish the turn yet.Yeah.Yeah, yeah the flooding.Or, you did that.Oh.'Cause that might help us with the decisions.(Right).No.Oh, crap.Water rise, but we also got a fly.So-.Yes.Ok.Right, and we're still only at-.We're still only on three.Still only on three.Ok, so-.That's right.Thank you Messenger.You're welcome.And our two ones that we need are also not-.And they- they have someone standing by to flip them.In danger right now.Mmhmm.To shore them up.Use the verbage.We're gettin' close. What's our next one that we're going after?.Alright.That's what I was tr-.The chalice.Tryin' to thnk of.Yeah.Yeah.Ok, so-.The chalice I guess, ha- we have more options with the chalice. But let's see where we are.We have Dunes of Deception-.Is gone-.Ok.'Kay-.Misty Marsh-.Flip that guy.And Bronze Gate-.Is gone.Bronze Gate is gone.Ok.(Our island's getting smaller).And then- you're done, right?.Correct.Alright.Alright, so-.Can you give all three of those?.Yeah, one, two, three.That would be my three actions. I just wouldn't be able to do anything else.That's your three actions.Ok.(Yep).And then I'm gonna fly-.Myself.There to prep for it.Do you have to wait for your-.Turn?.No, this is play at anytime.Ok.So you wanna fly-.So even-.Over here?.Yeah.'Kay, and then you need to dump-.So-.Ok, so-.One, two, three, four, five. I'm gonna get rid of these.Mm.Right? That makes sense?.Yep.Yeah, 'cause that's already gone.Yep.Yep.We've already, captured that one.And then, even if-.Anything happens with this-.We still have this one on call so you can fly me there and then we can flip.And we have two people-.Yeah.Well-.Yeah, ready to go.Did we cheat?.(--).Oh, so we do have to keep one of those.Yeah, you used that.If you use it, you have to get rid of it.The- the lift, did you use it or was it just a regualr move?.No, she did move.Yeah, that was just.But it wasn't your turn so it would've been a special card.You're right, you're right.Yeah.It's not my turn yet, 'cause you still have to pull your these.So I just pulled these two and then I need three-.Ok.Flooded ones.Please don't be two Coral Palaces.Silver Gate-.Buh-bye.Uh oh.Ok.Hm.Watchtower-.Uh oh.And-.Whisper Garden- Whispering Garden.Ooh.Ok.And then I'm finished.Ok, so now I'm at this.We have our three.S-.Yeah.So that's one.Yeah, we're done.So we have our three treasures.But now we have to get off the island.Oh, true.Right, so now we need to all get to the-.Ok.So I'm just gonna-.Which we're all really close.That was one action.One-.Fly per turn to any tile. Ok, so I can only move myself so I'm just gonna move myself-.Here.Yeah.And just hang out.'Kay.And wait for us.And then we need to protect the chalice, still.Why.For-.No-.For you to get there.There's just like- we need to get- we need to make sure you have a path to get there.You mean all of us?.All of us do, yeah.Yeah.Or, we can try to have you guys cluster somewhere and then you-.Oh no.Yeah, well let's just see how the next-.You're right.You're right.Yeah.Couple turns go.I'm just saying, we're- even though we're not going after it anymore we need to be aware of it.Yeah, I was re-.Fifteen minute- I put a lot of my energy into getting these treasures. Were you guys thinking that too? We're like, let's get the treausres- ok.Yeah.Alright.So you need your two cards?.I'm (gonna) flip-.Yep.Chalice and a sandbag.S-.Oh good.Sandbags are good.Yes.Yeah.They are.You got one, too. We can use them at anytime.Counted.Yep.So if there's any risk of-.Any of these going anywhere, sandbag it.Right.Ok.So-.Did you-.Flood.And we need three of those.Now you need three.Right.(You) sound so anxious Engineer.Temple of the Sun, that's already gone, isn't it?.Down there.Oh ok.It is now.It is now.It is now.Now it is.Buh-bye.Temple of the Moon.Flip.And Howling Garden.That one I-.Right there.(--).Ok.Alright.Alright.My turn?.Explorer-.I think you gotta start moving toward the helicopter pad.Yep.Yeah.So I'm right here so I can move here-.One-.One-.Move again.Does anybo-.Two.Yeah.She just move again, yeah.Yeah.Move again.Just move one more time.There's nothing else to do.Ok.Cool.And I guess it doesn't really matter 'cause we already have so just-.Nope.You can keep one of them, how 'bout the fire?.Oh.And then flood.Alright and then the-.Three.Alright, Tidal Palace-.I wonder if I should've- oh, you know I should've-.That's alright, we don't need it.Yeah.Um, Cliffs of Abandon.That's alright, too.And Copper Gate.Can I-.Can we just-.Sandbag that guy?.Or I can flip it.Wa- yeah, 'cause it's your turn now.Right, ok.Right.Yeah.And you can still get there in

What did you pick up?.So I have.like I mean sandbags seem like they could be helpful..Well they're helpful in the sense like.Oh but.you could save this..They don't also they don't.yeah that's probably good..They don't take up a turn..Some--.You know what I mean?.Mhm..Yeah so maybe.um if you don't wanna really focus on this one since you already have two chalices.Yeah I already have two..Yeah..um I'll get rid of this one.Okay..and.I'll play sandbags soon..Do you wanna go ahead and do uh cause there's only oh.You.Okay..he can't cause his.turn ended..What!.Yeah..(--)..Okay yup..Yeah..Um.Iron Gate, Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden..Lost Lagoon is gone..Iron Gate is gone..Oh Whispering Garden is gone..Whispering Garden is gone..All three are gone?.That's what I got..Yeah..Oh goodness..Lost Lagoon..And.What is this? Iron Gate?.All gone..and Iron Gate?.That is not good..So we should.save that..Howling Garden yeah..Um.looking ahead at you. How far are you?.I have one of these that I need to get to you..Yeah..But to get to you we need to be on the same thing.which I can do.You can move diagonally..on my next turn, yeah..But then after that, someone has to airlift us or we have to travel.Yeah..Diagonally..to get to.What..that card because we just lost this card..I've got two helicopter lifts. I can save one for.Hm..the end of the game..You could move towards me and give it to me and I could airlift them after..Um.well.um.Or can we move that?.yeah..Probably..Uh wait so what are we. I I mean I was going to make part of it I'm right here so I guess I could.So what..You cannot give special, nevermind..Ignore me..I, we don't..I think that maybe.Um.we'll have a.well we can we're gonna have to wait till we get around but.Well.is is--.Would it be too soon to um.to use a helicopter? Because what I could imagine is if you were to move me.to here.then.on your turn you could come here.Give me the card..give me the card.and then.On your turn, come around and you can move down..and then I can then move down and.That's smart..Well I'm.You guys got it together..Hm I'm confused. I was going to give her this on my move that way you could give her that on your move and then.Well that's one that's one right.Right..And then that way you could kinda already.be there..Yeah you could..Well no that works anyway..Okay and that's why you want her to be there..Move to me.Give it to me..No no she he will--. Okay you give that, That's one turn is giving her your card right?.Okay..Right that's.You have to be on the same tile as me though..Oh..Oh yeah okay..So just move towards me. You've only, have you done anything yet?.No..Hm..But yeah if she.Yeah just move towards me and then give it to me..Sounds good..Then helicopter lift him to that..That's two..Two..Two and then you can helicopter lift.him to.Coral Palace..And that doesn't even count as a move..If one or move, well--.Okay I need you and.you who are grey..Well no you could only move the gray..Can only--I mean if they were on the same tile I just didn't remember what color he was..That's it..And then you still have one more move if you want..And then discard your--.You have to discard the helicopter lift..Correct..Um.(--)..Um.And then you have.you have one move if you want to use it..Do you want to just flip.I'll just.Hm..yeah..Just for funsies. Okay.Just for funsies..Um I'll.move these.and.three of those..Ugh..I hate that..You need Copper Gate..It just hurts..Crimson.Forest..And Temple of the Sun..Oh they changed spots..I feel like this has been called Temple of the Sun..Look it up.winner.Empire of the Sun..Okay so my turn..Empire of the Sun..I have to move first..Uh.To here..And make sure to yeah.Right..And you need a.One.Two.Well..Well well oh you need to give her the chalice..I'm--.Well yeah that's (not) two moves..Okay..That's that..Two..Um.that's two moves..That that's actually, so.if you're gonna give her the card you're here already so you'd have to give her--.So if.you're here--.Oh..Give it to me and then move and then give it to him..Uh.Maybe? Yes..One.Yeah and that would be three..And then I'll I'll discard.fire cause I'm not doing it..Not about that life..And then if you move forward and then give me that, I'll discard this..Okay..Two..Three..Okay..Okay..Two cards..Ugh..Water Rise's..I'm not the only one..Pass me those..And I.just take two, right?.Or three?.Take.three..Okay..Temple of the Moon,.Copper gate,.We really need to save Temple of the Sun, right?.Temple of the Moon..Yeah..Cliffs of Abandon..I like the,.it's a weird thing to say but I like that some of these are Temple of the Moon, Temple of the Sun..I like that..Oh yeah they're like they're connected like cave cave..Then the Iron Gate's..Yes..I like that..Temple temple..Palace palace..Okay it is my turn..Take a treasure! Take a treasure!.I'm gonna flip this first..I don't need to flip that one..I'd.I would say flip these two anyways. It's all you can do two for one action..flip Temple of the M--.Well--.I can't get this cause I'm not diagonal..Oh..I'll just do that..So that's two moves..Um we definitely want to make sure to.That's one move..Two moves..You can get the.safe Temple of the Moon..palace peice..Oh yes..Yeah if it if it.does (it both)..Oh wait.um.wait.you still have.one move..Mhm..I have one move, yeah..Um..You don't have to use it. I don't know if there's anything you can do..Well--.Um.I can move back up so I'm close to it..you can.are you with her.Hm..wait you're green. You're on the same card so maybe you can go ahead and just give her that because then shes already.Three moves..three..Okay..Well did I already get two. I didn't get two of those..But we need to make sure to save these..Yeah..Yeah we have one of each..I got a Helicopter Lift card and another Earth thing..Mhm..I don't need to shuffle them everytime..Temple of the Sun's gone..Well at least that's the farther one..Breaker's Bridge and Crimson Forest is gone..So we need to save this..Mhm..Uh no I just need.You need Temple of the Sun and the Crimson Forest.the Sun and Crimson Forest..Okay..Okay so my first move I'm going to play this to save Temple of the Moon..Uh..I don't even actually think that counts as a.Oh that's right..move so you still have three..Let's--.As move zero and um and then I will.Yes as move zero..One move.this and.two moves and I'm just going to move up..Oh look at that..(--) needs it anyway..Uh Dunes of Deception, Silver Gate, and Tidal Palace..I think Dunes of Deception is my favorite one..Uh..Okay..You're turn..Alright..I'm going to give this to you..Can you?.No..Now I can..Now I can..Thank you..So that's two moves and.Two..Uh.Oh we should all just stay there..Well..Oh well I have to move in a bit anyways but..You could helicopter lift us or something..You have a helicopter. I'm going to use your helicop--my helicopter since we're on the same tile..Or.yeah..I can move you there so then you have some.Would you want uh cause if you have one more move would you want to give me the fire one just in case..I.I would like that. Let's do that..And now there's.one (--)..Hm..Cave of Embers,.Oh sorry..Oh sorry no no..Bronze Gate,.Yes..and Cave of Shadows..Ah..So maybe let's try to save that one..Nothing else has sunk..Yeah..Okay so.You can get either since you have three..I can.And you have--.well let me move.You can move diagonally also. One two..And you can.s--.Um would you--.No don't do it. You should do this..Well.Oh yeah I have to do this immediately..That's yeah..We just really be careful because you.you can move diagonally but you might get stuck..We'll see what happens..We'll take the gambit..We have helicopter lifts if it does happen..Mhm..This goes there..Uh do you have more plays left..No she already did three..No I did three. I moved twice..Okay we--.Eh but that's okay we'll se what happens..Does.I'll helicopter lift you to.Um.Fool's Landing..But we have.three so we can.get to Fool's Landing actually..Watch Tower..Yeah..Misty Marsh..And.Uh Howling Garden..Oh nothing sunk..Okay..We're on a streak!.So.I have a Helicopter Lift so if you want to go ahead and use your Helicopter Lift to get everyone together.Yes..I'm gonna.To get me to Coral Palace..Or.to.I'm gonna put you here though. Should that be smarter?.Yeah..Cause we can move there..Mhm..We might get stuck though..Yeah..No no um.Yeah actually.Well move me here anyways but then you can use your one move to.I can yeah.Um.I wait.to shore up.I think.What's up..This doesn't even count as a move, so..Hold on hold on..Um..Okay..What do you guys--.You have--.Uh..Um..Yes..Actually I'm not sure what I was thinking about that one..I was thinking like you we need one of those to.I'll do it..Yeah cause you can do shore twice..like (--)..Two of them, no?.Eh..Here it is. This is one move..And.And that was this is already oh no that was okay yeah..and I can move.So that's really only.there..I can do that.Oh..for no reason. Should I not do that?.Oh wait you don't really need to do that just go to uh.Fool's Landing..I'll go to Fool's Landing..Yeah..Okay..Thank you..Helicopter Lift and Water's Rise..Water's Rise..That's sad. Here's this..Everything's going to sink..Well nothing around us is important.that needs.That is true. And I just.did that so.they'll just get water they'll just get flooded..Mhm..I really like the cards when they're blue. I think they look cool..Oh good..Alright take one..Two..Three..Silver Gate is.gone..Cliffs of Abandon.are gone..And Breaker's.Bridge.is gone..Not that any of those.Nope..Okay so.uh there's like not a lot for me to do right now..Just go to Fool's Landing..You could just move yourself to Fool's Landing if you wanted..Yeah and then I can use one of my cards to go to Fool's or two plays and then one helicopter lift so.Oh that's right cause we already have three treasures. What am I thinking. Okay so.Yeah..One..Two..And yeah..And you Pilot yourself here and then use your Helicopter Lift to get out..Wow we finished that really early..Mhm..Okay so there's that and.We could get the fire one if we really wanted too..But we shouldn't..Nah we shouldn't risk it..They're both flooded..Uh Watch Tower.Mh hm..Misty Marsh is gone..And Dunes of Deception is gone..I do like this card..Tile..Okay..It's pretty..Um.so we can.You can't well I guess that counts as one too..I I fly..But can you fly.Oh yeah..Yeah..She can do whatever she wants..Yeah since--.So that was one a--one move..Yeah and then so--.We finished the game..Oh look at that..Wow..Ten minutes faster..Wow..More than ten minutes faster..That was fifteen minutes faster..Boom.

Okay.No.Just me.Um.so that's one two and.I guess I can just leave this as one.Lost lagoon's not really.Oh.Important as much.super--.It's only.Okay.And.Phantom Rock and Cliff's of Abandon.Phantom Rock's gone.Hm.Goodness.Okay.Let me see here.Hm.I.may.hm.well.I think I'm going to move.hm.Wait oh do you want to see if we have enough.nevermind.just.We don't.But.Okay.Yup.Good move.Hm.Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.Oh I forgot that they're different now.They're different places.We can kind of.start decerning who should have.Mhm.Well we've done one round so.Yeah so okay.I mean.discussion time.I think maybe I should do chalice since I already have two.Yeah and we both have two.And I'll do the lion?.Yeah and you can do uh.And you can give.you can give it to anyone right?.Mhm.Oh okay.I can either do Chalice or the Fire.depending.It might not be a bad thing if you have.a couple options yeah.Some option.Yeah.Mhm and you.what I'm on a fire card.Yes.You're on a Chalice card or a Earth (stone) card already.Yeah.I mean we're all bound to move.I could just go to the Chalice.Around.Mhm.once Water's Rises so.maybe maybe more focus on who has the cards.Okay.Um.Okay you're turn.So my turn.I will.shore up Cliff's of Abandon.and.move two to here.for no reason.I'm the only one who's gotten these.Uh.Water's Rise.Cliff's of Abandon, Temple of the Moon, and Breaker's Bridge.Once again.Wasted.What was the last one?.Um Breaker's Bridge, Temple of the Moon, Cliff's of Abandon.Temple of the Moon.That's not really good.Okay and then another four.sunk so we're good.Okay.Okay um.well I think I'm going to.move here.flip this one.and then uh I guess.shore up this one.too.Okay.Um okay so I.am going to uh.Do you--.What are the other cards you have? What did you pick up?.So I have.like I mean sandbags seem like they could be helpful.Well they're helpful in the sense like.Oh but.you could save this.They don't also they don't.yeah that's probably good.They don't take up a turn.Some--.You know what I mean?.Mhm.Yeah so maybe.um if you don't wanna really focus on this one since you already have two chalices.Yeah I already have two.Yeah.um I'll get rid of this one.Okay.and.I'll play sandbags soon.Do you wanna go ahead and do uh cause there's only oh.You.Okay.he can't cause his.turn ended.What!.Yeah.(--).Okay yup.Yeah.Um.Iron Gate, Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden.Lost Lagoon is gone.Iron Gate is gone.Oh Whispering Garden is gone.Whispering Garden is gone.All three are gone?.That's what I got.Yeah.Oh goodness.Lost Lagoon.And.What is this? Iron Gate?.All gone.and Iron Gate?.That is not good.So we should.save that.Howling Garden yeah.Um.looking ahead at you. How far are you?.I have one of these that I need to get to you.Yeah.But to get to you we need to be on the same thing.which I can do.You can move diagonally.on my next turn, yeah.But then after that, someone has to airlift us or we have to travel.Yeah.Diagonally.to get to.What.that card because we just lost this card.I've got two helicopter lifts. I can save one for.Hm.the end of the game.You could move towards me and give it to me and I could airlift them after.Um.well.um.Or can we move that?.yeah.Probably.Uh wait so what are we. I I mean I was going to make part of it I'm right here so I guess I could.So what.You cannot give special, nevermind.Ignore me.I, we don't.I think that maybe.Um.we'll have a.well we can we're gonna have to wait till we get around but.Well.is is--.Would it be too soon to um.to use a helicopter? Because what I could imagine is if you were to move me.to here.then.on your turn you could come here.Give me the card.give me the card.and then.On your turn, come around and you can move down.and then I can then move down and.That's smart.Well I'm.You guys got it together.Hm I'm confused. I was going to give her this on my move that way you could give her that on your move and then.Well that's one that's one right.Right.And then that way you could kinda already.be there.Yeah you could.Well no that works anyway.Okay and that's why you want her to be there.Move to me.Give it to me.No no she he will--. Okay you give that, That's one turn is giving her your card right?.Okay.Right that's.You have to be on the same tile as me though.Oh.Oh yeah okay.So just move towards me. You've only, have you done anything yet?.No.Hm.But yeah if she.Yeah just move towards me and then give it to me.Sounds good.Then helicopter lift him to that.That's two.Two.Two and then you can helicopter lift.him to.Coral Palace.And that doesn't even count as a move.If one or move, well--.Okay I need you and.you who are grey.Well no you could only move the gray.Can only--I mean if they were on the same tile I just didn't remember what color he was.That's it.And then you still have one more move if you want.And then discard your--.You have to discard the helicopter lift.Correct.Um.(--).Um.And then you have.you have one move if you want to use it.Do you want to just flip.I'll just.Hm.yeah.Just for funsies. Okay.Just for funsies.Um I'll.move these.and.three of those.Ugh.I hate that.You need Copper Gate.It just hurts.Crimson.Forest.And Temple of the Sun.Oh they changed spots.I feel like this has been called Temple of the Sun.Look it up.winner.Empire of the Sun.Okay so my turn.Empire of the Sun.I have to move first.Uh.To here.And make sure to yeah.Right.And you need a.One.Two.Well.Well well oh you need to give her the chalice.I'm--.Well yeah that's (not) two moves.Okay.That's that.Two.Um.that's two moves.That that's actually, so.if you're gonna give her the card you're here already so you'd have to give her--.So if.you're here--.Oh.Give it to me and then move and then give it to him.Uh.Maybe? Yes.One.Yeah and that would be three.And then I'll I'll discard.fire cause I'm not doing it.Not about that life.And then if you move forward and then give me that, I'll discard this.Okay.Two.Three.Okay.Okay.Two cards.Ugh.Water Rise's.I'm not the only one.Pass me those.And I.just take two, right?.Or three?.Take.three.Okay.Temple of the Moon,.Copper gate,.We really need to save Temple of the Sun, right?.Temple of the Moon.Yeah.Cliffs of Abandon.I like the,.it's a weird thing to say but I like that some of these are Temple of the Moon, Temple of the Sun.I like that.Oh yeah they're like they're connected like cave cave.Then the Iron Gate's.Yes.I like that.Temple temple.Palace palace.Okay it is my turn.Take a treasure! Take a treasure!.I'm gonna flip this first.I don't need to flip that one.I'd.I would say flip these two anyways. It's all you can do two for one action.flip Temple of the M--.Well--.I can't get this cause I'm not diagonal.Oh.I'll just do that.So that's two moves.Um we definitely want to make sure to.That's one move.Two moves.You can get the.safe Temple of the Moon.palace peice.Oh yes.Yeah if it if it.does (it both).Oh wait.um.wait.you still have.one move.Mhm.I have one move, yeah.Um.You don't have to use it. I don't know if there's anything you can do.Well--.Um.I can move back up so I'm close to it.you can.are you with her.Hm.wait you're green. You're on the same card so maybe you can go ahead and just give her that because then shes already.Three moves.three.Okay.Well did I already get two. I didn't get two of those.But we need to make sure to save these.Yeah.Yeah we have one of each.I got a Helicopter Lift card and another Earth thing.Mhm.I don't need to shuffle them everytime.Temple of the Sun's gone.Well at least that's the farther one.Breaker's Bridge and Crimson Forest is gone.So we need to save this.Mhm.Uh no I just need.You need Temple of the Sun and the Crimson Forest.the Sun and Crimson Forest.Okay.Okay so my first move I'm going to play this to save Temple of the Moon.Uh.I don't even actually think that counts as a.Oh that's right.move so you still have three.Let's--.As move zero and um and then I will.Yes as move zero.One move.this and.two moves and I'm just going to move up.Oh look at that.(--) needs it anyway.Uh Dunes of Deception, Silver Gate, and Tidal Palace.I think Dunes of Deception is my favorite one.Uh.Okay.You're turn.Alright.I'm going to give this to you.Can you?.No.Now I can.Now I can.Thank you.So that's two moves and.Two.Uh.Oh we should all just stay there.Well.Oh well I have to move in a bit anyways but.You could helicopter lift us or something.You have a helicopter. I'm going to use your helicop--my helicopter since we're on the same tile.Or.yeah.I can move you there so then you have some.Would you want uh cause if you have one more move would you want to give me the fire one just in case.I.I would like that. Let's do that.And now there's.one (--).Hm.Cave of Embers,.Oh sorry.Oh sorry no no.Bronze Gate,.Yes.and Cave of Shadows.Ah.So maybe let's try to save that one.Nothing else has sunk.Yeah.Okay so.You can get either since you have three.I can.And you have--.well let me move.You can move diagonally also. One two.And you can.s--.Um would you--.No don't do it. You should do this.Well.Oh yeah I have to do this immediately.That's yeah.We just really be careful because you.you can move diagonally but you might get stuck.We'll see what happens.We'll take the gambit.We have helicopter lifts if it does happen.Mhm.This goes there.Uh do you have more plays left.No she already did three.No I did three. I moved twice.Okay we--.Eh but that's okay we'll se what happens.Does.I'll helicopter lift you to.Um.Fool's Landing.But we have.three so we can.get to Fool's Landing actually.Watch Tower.Yeah.Misty Marsh.And.Uh Howling Garden.Oh nothing sunk.Okay.We're on a streak!.So.I have a Helicopter Lift so if you want to go ahead and use your Helicopter Lift to get everyone together.Yes.I'm gonna.To get me to Coral Palace.Or.to.I'm gonna put you here though. Should that be smarter?.Yeah.Cause we can move there.Mhm.We might get stuck though.Yeah.No no um.Yeah actually.Well move me here anyways but then you can use your one move to.I can yeah.Um.I wait.to shore up.I think.What's up.This doesn't even count as a move, so.Hold on hold on.Um.Okay.What do you guys--.You have--.Uh.Um.Yes.Actually I'm not sure what I was thinking about that one.I was thinking like you we need one of those to.I'll do it.Yeah cause you can do shore twice.like (--).Two of them, no?.Eh.Here it is. This is one move.And.And that was this is already oh no that was okay yeah.and I can move.So that's really only.there.I can do that.Oh.for no reason. Should I not do that?.Oh wait you don't really need to do that just go to uh.Fool's Landing.I'll go to Fool's Landing.Yeah.Okay.Thank you.Helicopter Lift and Water's Rise.Water's Rise.That's sad. Here's this.Everything's going to sink.Well nothing around us is important.that needs.That is true. And I just.did that so.they'll just get water they'll just get flooded.Mhm.I really like the cards when they're blue. I think they look cool.Oh good.Alright take one.Two.Three.Silver Gate is.gone.Cliffs of Abandon.are gone.And Breaker's.Bridge.is gone.Not that any of those.Nope.Okay so.uh there's like not a lot for me to do right now.Just go to Fool's Landing.You could just move yourself to Fool's Landing if you wanted.Yeah and then I can use one of my cards to go to Fool's or two plays and then one helicopter lift so.Oh that's right cause we already have three treasures. What am I thinking. Okay so.Yeah.One.Two.And yeah.And you Pilot yourself here and then use your Helicopter Lift to get out.Wow we finished that really early.Mhm.Okay so there's that and.We could get the fire one if we really wanted too.But we shouldn't.Nah we shouldn't risk it.They're both flooded.Uh Watch Tower.Mh hm.Misty Marsh is gone.And Dunes of Deception is gone.I do like this card.Tile.Okay.It's pretty.Um.so we can.You can't well I guess that counts as one too.I I fly.But can you fly.Oh yeah.Yeah.She can do whatever she wants.Yeah since--.So that was one a--one move.Yeah and then so--.We finished the game.Oh look at that.Wow.Ten minutes faster.Wow.More than ten minutes faster.That was fifteen minutes faster.Boom.

Team5252.csv,"Cool..Alright..So you can shore up two.Awesome..Okay..""hmm"".You could shore up.these two.move and then shore up these two..Oh wait, nevermind..No..No..No..I was thinking.Oh yeah..that he was me, sorry..Yeah..Sure. This one.Hmm.So could've you..So you could do that one.and then you could do.those two..Why do you say not there?.No, you can do that one..Can you shore up the one that you're on?.Yes..Yeah? Okay..Yeah..Okay..So, that's one move to move..So, one move..And then one shore up, and then that would be considered, if you do those two at once, that would be considered.Yeah..your third move..You dont have to move to--.No, yeah. Stay on the Whispering Garden..Mhm, and then these two..Cause that just counts as one action..Sweet..Hey,.I didn't flood..Oh..Oh, well..Oh, well..It's alright..I spoke too soon..Just get it over with..Well, wait a minute. We have.cards in our dis--.That's okay. It was like that before, too..Yeah, they're supposed to be there..Yes, we don't have to put those back in..No..No?.I got it right..Ra-ra-raise..Mhm.Yup..Yup..Yeah, they do have to go back in..Yes, they do. Okay..Oh, right now. Yeah, okay..Yeah..Well..You do that first..Okay..Just gonna..And then.the water card goes over here..Just the Water Rise's one, yeah..Uh huh..And then you need to draw two..Mhm..So..Lost Lagoon..Is that, yeah go ahead..Where is that?.Nope. That's a rare..We lose it..Oh..Oh..Oh..Thankfully we didn't need it..So we need the Forgiven Island card..Mhm..Mhm..Or, no. Whatever it's called..Breaker's Bridge..Okay..And then that goes here..Not that one. Just the.Just the card..The card..Just the.Uh.Oh..blue card thing..Mhm..Okay..Okay. That's it..Cool..Alright, so let's see..(--).It's really not much..Should I move here and.do that?.Yeah..Um..And then that way.just trying to see, like..Yeah, and you're close to all of these if you need to get to them..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Okay..Umm..Maybe I should just move.here..What is your one card there?.Okay..Or, should I give.maybe I should give this to him?.Yeah..Yeah..Since I'm on the same thing..Mhm..That's so nice of you. Thank you..Here we go. No problem..And, so those are your three?.Yeah..Yeah..Alright..So, sandbags and this? Cool..And then just two of these..Phantom Rock..That's gone..And Gold Gate..Which is also at the bottom..(--).That's alright. We can do without those..Yup..Alright..That's it?.That's it, yup..Okay. Um, so I'm here..Mhm..Do I even want to do anything?.I can,.Do you wanna.I mean in terms of like trading stuff..It would pretty much be equal. I could trade but it doesn't matter..Yeah. It doesn't matter..I would keep that there then..And I think I'm in like a good central location near all of these..Yeah. Plus you're already here..So, I don't think I should do anything..Yeah..So I'll just draw my cards..Go ahead..And, oh, two of those..Cliffs of Abandon..And Whisper Garden..Alright..Well, here's my first move..I'm going to move here..And.shore up.(--).No..Oh, you could probably.That's what I was going to ask. Should I make? Because that was one and two..I can't do that on this turn..Yeah..I'll have to wait..Oh yeah, you could..So might as well wait and not.Yeah..wait until next turn to try and catch up..Yeah..Mhm..So you might as well. Yeah..Go ahead and shore up that one for my third turn..Mhm,.And here is.Cause that was originally my thought until we flooded those two..Yeah, good plan..That makes sense. Yeah..Think that's priority..So we can both get our fire cards.Okay..to the Engineer.Right..Mhm..And then I can also take your.So..lion at some point..And then I need two flood cards, please..Okay..Moved over here. So there's that. And then Iron Gate.is there..Alright..So..If you guys are gonna.Same..plan on giving that to him then he should maybe think about getting closer to there..Mhm..And I think if we all stay relatively close, I know a lot of us have cards to like give to each other..Yeah..And one nice thing, go ahead move, is.the treasures are all.Close to each other..Yeah..relatively at least these four are close together..So you still have two more moves so you could actu ally move right on there..He could move right on there..Right on there..On the.On this one..Oh, oh..Cause since you have.these two.they can plan on giving those to you..And then you can take that treasure..So then your next turn, not, yeah..Not yet though, yeah..Mhm..Okay, so..Here are two and you can only keep.One of those..How come I always get the Water Rise..Are you.Oh nevermind, he gets to keep, the one. Yes..So you have to play that one. So then that means.Yeah, so then give away..Give away the lion..(Do).Well he can keep the lion then, cause that's.Oh yeah, cause he's.then he'll only be at five anyway..Okay, yeah..Oh, cause he has to give other.Yeah, so the Water Rise's..I can give that away..Well this one, we're gonna, we have to play it right away..Mhm..So, we have to move the water up..Well you get to keep everything else though..Mhm..Alright..So we're already in the three zone here..Shuffle these up..Okay..And (--) flood cards now..Three of them..There you go..It's Whispering Garden..Oh..Temple of the Moon..Oh, no..It's gone..Sorry about that..It's okay..We have to protect that one..Yeah..Cliffs of Abandon..They're not going to go here..Alright..Alright, so..I need to think about.I could shore up.I'm definitely going to shore.these.two up..And then.I'm going to think about moving down here..Um.so maybe I'll just shore these two up..and then move here..Yeah..Okay..Yeah, sounds good..Could I.Alright, ouh..And.there we go.It's fine..Mhm..Yeah..And.three of these..Howling Garden,.where you at..Iron Gate, that's gone..And Breaker's Bridge.is flooded..Okay, that's it..Okay..So, I need to get my.fire one to the Engineer..So, he, I'm here..So one move could be helicopter.there..Mhm..And another move is giving you this. So you have to get rid of.one..You have to get rid of something, yeah..Maybe it should be the.Gold,.oh no..Maybe, no one else has any of those teal ones so maybe get rid of one of those..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Cause this, you'll probably want to keep to give to her eventually, so get rid of this one..Yeah, I'm a Leo so I have.I have problems getting rid of that lion..So am I..Good..Oh, really?.Mhm..Oh, Okay..August or July?.August..August, July..Is there one more.turn?.Yeah, I think you have one more..Oh, yeah it's my turn, I forgot it was, I thought it was his turn, okay..It's okay..Um..I don't think I should do anything. Actually, I should get closer to.explore.because.You have to make a (--) better..I have to.so I'll just get in the middle there..That works..And I know you have two of these, uh.Whoopsie..and three flood cards..Uh, Cave of Embers.Awesome..Okay..Alright.So.Where, look at your green, yeah..I'm blue..So then I'll shore up.Mhm..Breaker's Bridge, since you're on your way to me..Mhm..Um.I think just staying where I am is probably the best bet..Yeah..Oh and you should.Give that to hi--.actually.if you move here and then moved diagonally.I'll reach.you'd be ready to give, well, hm..Oh..and you don't have a helicopter, right?.Mhm..Are we saying cause then we would have to undo that shore up?.Wait a minute..It's not an important card..It's not..Yeah..Oh wait, yeah..I don't think it..Yeah, I think you should just move to him and.Give him that..Cause it, the, like the point of the game is to get the.Right..thing so it's more important..And I mean,.this.I don't know. I don't, it's not that important, yeah..So it, it could go, yeah..Yeah..So you could move one two and your third action would be to give the card to the Engineer..Right..Sounds good..And I can shore that up, too..Yeah..And there's.there.they were all (--).ehh (--).you don't need to.You don't need to get rid of your other teal card..Okay..And..And now, his turn, right?.(--).Um, we need to do flood cards..Nope. Cards. Yup..Oh yeah. Oh duh..Oh, you need these two?.I need my treasure cards..Oops..Yeah..One, to Water's Rise..Okay..Yes..Put that there..Alrighty..Three of them..Go ahead, do the honors..Alright. Whispering Garden's..Breaker's Bridge..Who all..Bye..So, since.You get to swim..I'm here.I should swim..You get to swim to.wherever you.If you swam to me, I could give you this..yeah, so..Yeah..Bam..And Howling Garden's..So Breaker's Bridge's took the tile..Oh, Howling Garden's is gone..Okay..Uh oh. We need to save Whispering Garden..Mhm..Alright..Alright..Okay. Hmm..This is definitely proving more of a challenge than last time. I mean not that it wasn't hard but yeah like it's..Oh.you have..Yeah..Little bit, yeah..Yeah..So you can turn in your four fire.Mhm..cards..and capture the treasure?.Yeah..Yup..Yup..Go get it..There you go..Alright. So that means I'm the first one to get a treasure..Yeah..Yes..Hey..So, that was just one..I get one more move..You got two more..Oh, two more?.Well..Mhm..Hmm..How about going over here..Wait, actually.actually a good move would be giving me our, our shared Leo.Right..Oh, yeah..since we're right here together this is be the best time to do that..You're right. You're right..Yeah..So, two. Yup..That could have been right. That's right..And you don't really need to do anything..Cause I mean, the two of us could shore this one..Yeah..Yeah..Cause we need to do that..Yeah..Okay..So, yeah. I think that's good..Okay. So let's just pray that it shouldn't, it's not going to be uncovered right now..Well, wait we have to do the treausre first..Oh, oh my gosh, sorry..Here are your treausre cards..Oh, i got the helicopter lift again..Nice..What's that guy..And no water rise's. Phew..And I got the Leo. Maybe I'll get a chance to give it to you..And.Alright..Okay..So, these are for you..Oh, that (--) so well..Good news is Whispering Garden is here so..Yeah that's what I was really worried about was getting another and losing that..Copper Gate..Which one is it?.Copper Gate..Copper Gate..Oh, um, no I used that one..Bye. Bye..Cave of Ember..Also, okay..Crimson Forest..That one didn't matter..Alright..Okay..We're still okay..Okay we're still good. Got it..Alright, so.I'm gonna.help this guy..Yeah..So, move one.One..two.Two..Um, and then I should move back to somebody..Ehh..Yeah..I was gonna say actually..You can move to me and I can give you this on my next turn..Your blue, yeah..Yeah. I was gonna say actually if you just keep moving, the next.turn.Yeah..then straight down..Yeah..Hurry up..So..So, trade your cards..Yup..Alright, so..Oh..Okay. This is gonna be okay..Wait,.I have these. Are we going to do anything with these?.Wait, what are these?.No. I think we've got like these and those and I don't think we're even going to use it..Nah..Alright, well then in that case.Does, yeah I think we're good so just.I'm gonna discard them because these sandbags might come in handy..Yeah..Yeah..Alright so three (of these).Dunes of Deception..Oh, I can't turn around far enough..Silver Gate.and.Cliffs of Abandon..Okay. Um, for my first move, I'll give you.this..Okay and I'm going to get rid of this..And then,.(--) that treasure..I have two more moves so I could move to Explorer and give her.Yup..Yeah..my Leo..Mhm..And then we're super set up..So you area.green.okay..Green..And there you go..And then I get rid of this..Oh good. They're the ones we don't want..Okay so Coral Place.we're okay with that..Bronze Gate..Where is that..Up there.Okay..So you can turn yours in. Oh, well you have to get to the tile. Shoot..I'm trying to think exactly..Oh you can move diagonally..Wait,.okay you're green and we need.Yeah..So you can do one two and then get that..One..Two..Yeah. Except, here's the problem with that..What?.If it floods again..and I lose either this or this, I can't get back to the landing..Okay. Um, then we should.Engineer the, oh, yeah, you're right. Okay..That's the only problem..Cause we're worried about, well.Yeah..(--) House and Cliffs of Abandon, are those in, well even if it.floods, then that would mess it up..Because then I have to survive..Should we hold off?.We might..Well you could actually go.That's right. Because I can do diagonal. Glad you thought of that..Yeah..Yeah..because we'd have to go a whole time around.Right..to wait to, um..And we're not going to lose this.Yeah..and this..Anytime soon, yeah..Right..Within one round..Mhm..So you should.So, okay, yeah..you should maybe.shore up that..Or no. Like after..Alright, that's, you only have one turn..Oh you only have one turn left. Oh yeah youre right. Sorry. Sorry sorry sorry yeah you're good..Yeah cause she had to do two moves..Right, yeah. Cause I did one, yeah..Mhm..So do that, okay. Now my two treausre cards, please..Okay, so we can do this..Don't be. Yes! No floods..Yes!.Alright and now, three flight cards..Okay..Okay. The Tower, the Watch Tower..Misty Marsh.We'll save that one, or well we can save it, it doesn't really matter..and then Temple of the Sun.which is the last one at the bottom here..Okay..Okay, so.this is where I need to get to..I think Engineer can probably get.like these two.Und--yeah..in one move..Yeah..Mhm..Say that again..You could get those two and those two. Well not that they're that important though..Actually..These ones might prove to be important, well this one because of, yeah getting to Fool's Landing so he should definitely do that..That one, mhm..That's, that's what I was thinking..Might as well..Unless we, yeah..Well, so what you want to do.Well, wait..Yeah, take that one back..Wait..Wait, cause now, our whole plan.I still can't move diagonal at this I mean if we.Let's shore these ones up.and then move..So,.pretend like we didn't move..If we shore that one and this one at least..Yup..Yeah, those like are necessities..Those two, one move..That counts as yeah and that counts as one..Yup..Yeah cause he can do two at one time..Okay..So then he could move, you could move here and shore that one up.and that would be all your moves..Cause then that way he's really close to Fool's Landing..Right..Okay..But,.There we are..oh okay..Then I'm still safe for being able even if we lose these two..Yeah..Yeah, cause you can get.I can still get out..there..Alright, we're good. Okay. Cool..That's it right? So,.Yup..Yeah..So you can, oh..you need these?.Oh god, is that a Water's Rise's?.Oh, I got a water rise. Sorry about that..It is..It's not your fault..It's alright..I got that. Another.There's a lot of cards in there so there's like not as much of a chance that you would get rid of that one..and another helicopter lift..That's good..Yeah..Okay..The first time we had two helicopters..Mhm..You do too..Oh yeah..Oh that's right cause you could always pilot me out..Yeah..If we did lose those..Mhm..Alright so three..Bronze Gate..All good..Swim..Oh..We don't care about that..No..Tidal Palace..I don't care about that either..We also don't care about that one..That won't do..(--).Water Gate..Water Gate..I just don't know. It's it's Whispering Garden..Silver Gate?.Whispering Garden..Whipsering Garden..Right..Oh, okay..I have not even..Well that's fine..Was she looking for Water Gate when I said that?.I was like, that's..That's funny. Yeah we were..Political scandal..You're like wait what..Alright, so that's it right?.Alright, yeah..Alright, so.my thing is going to be.move here so one two and then take, get that..Mhm..Yeah, perfect..And then everyone else will try to get back to Fool's Landing at this point..Yes..Yeah, okay..Okay, so..Um, wait I need to take two of these right?.We don't care about you..Watch Tower..There..Silver Gate is out.and.Dumes.of.Deception.Good..So, for me.I'm here..Mhm..Um,.I could go one, save that one and go to Fool's Landing..Or, well yeah, I could use really this..Yeah..I think that's what I would do..Yeah..Um..There we go..It doesn't really matter but I'll keep the sandbag just in case..Yeah, maybe we should use the sandbag.on that..Yeah that.Can you use that whenever?.play it anytime.Yeah..Yup..Let's do that..Well wait a minute, you've already done your moves..I think it doesn't count..Does it have to be anot--.Yeah it doesn't, does not count as an action it says..Oh, okay..So, wait..We really want this one, not that one..Sorry..Yeah cause you can move diagonally, so.Yeah..perfect..And I need three.water.cards..So, Temple of the Sun.and Misty Marsh..Oh, sorry..No, it's cool..Alright..Okay. Let's see my big two moves..One..There's one and then two..Two..You don't really need to do anything else..If I could have my two treasure cards, please..Alright,.and then three flood cards..Alright..Cave of Shadows.,.the Observatory,.and Coral Palace..Alright..I'm scared..Yeah..Okay, so, next move..You could always lift me..That's true.and it's Engineer's turn.Yeah..so he can actually get.that one.Yeah..at least..Or move one.Yeah..and then shore the one up.Oh yeah..that you're on and then..Well if he moves.to shore up.he can't move diagonally so he'd have to use two more turns to get back.Right..but we could lift him.Mhm..do you think?.Okay..I think either one would work like what are.you know..I, yeah think we really..We definitely need to save, we have so many helicopter lifts..Yeah, so let's.shore that one up, move there and then shore those two..Wait a minute..The helicopter lift, if we would use, if he would use one of those cards, could he just use it on anybody?.It says it can be played at anytime, does not count as an action..Do you need to be on the same.Tile as the person, no..no, yeah you can just move anyone from anywhere..No, it says.anyone..Yeah, so..So, if you want to, you can play.Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile..Yeah..So, how about we.you can flood.or you can, what is it called.Shore?.shore up this one.Mhm..and then with that move you get those two and then take your helicopter lift and move yourself back to Fool's L anding..Does that make sense?.So, shore up this.Yeah..then move here?.Actually, wait, back up a space..If he moves two, uses two, goes one, two.use a helicopter lift cause you can lift.Oh, lift us both there..it says lift one or more, correct?.Yeah. You can lift us both there..Yeah..Okay..Move one or more pawns on the same tile.And then we can bounce out.11 minutes..And then use that, get back here at least..So that's.and that doesn't count as an action..It does not..It does not count as an action.which is fine. Still play the next one and then we're out..Yeah..Right..There we go..So,.you you said move one, two.Mhm..and then lift us back here.Right..and then use the other helicopter to.Mhm..leave..Okay..Cool?.Oh my gosh, perfect..Is that it, yeah..You're saving the day again..Let's go through the motions here..And then lift that out..Then we'll.put this, yeah..Yeah.put that there.and then.bam..and there we are..And then we would use, what like your other card and then.There we are..Yay we're done!.Awesome!.Almost the same time..Yeah..Yeah..So now I can ask those questions?",u,ba  b  sd  ba  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  nn  nn  nn  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  qy  sd  sd  sd  qo  sd  qy  ny  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  ad  sd  sd  ba  fp  sd  b  b  b  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  nn  nn  sd  b  b  b  b  sd  aa  b  b  %  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  fc  qw  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  %  b  sd  b  b  sd  ba  ^h  %  sd  sd  ad  b  %  sd  sd  sv  b  b  b  b  %  sd  sd  qw  b  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  fc  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sv  b  b  aa  aa  sd  b  sd  sd  qy  sd  sv  aa  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  ad  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  %  nn  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  aa  sd  b  sd  b  b  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  aa  sv  sd  b  sd  b  b  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sd  %  b  %  %  aa  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  %  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  qy  sd  sd  sd  %  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  ba  sd  fa  sv  sd  b  sd  sv  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  b  aa  %  b  %  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  qw  sd  sd  qy  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  b  sd  %  qy  sv  b^m  ba  sd  b  b  b  ad  sd  sd  sd  ba  bh  b  bk  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  ^2  %  sv  sd  sd  ba  sd  ba  sd  sd  ba  b  b  %  qy  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  b  ad  ad  %  sd  sd  sv  b  qy  b  qy  sd  sv  sv  b  b  sd  sv  sd  sv  b  sv  sd  ba  sv  sd  b  sd  b  ba  sd  b  %  %  sd  nn  sv  sd  b  %  sd  %  sd  sd  aa  sd  sd  ba  b  sd  b  ny  sd  b  sd  ad  sd  sd  %  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  b  b  sv  b  %  b  sv  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  b  b  ad  ba  sd  b  ny  fp  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  b  b  ad  %  sd  b  b  sv  aa  b  aa  sv  sv  sd  b  b  sd  b  b  sv  sv  sd  fa  sd  sd  ba  qw  sd  sd  %  b  b  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  sd  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  ad  %  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  b  sd  b  ad  %  sd  b  b  b  sd  %  sd  qw  sd  nn  aa  sv  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  aa  sd  %  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sv  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  qy  sd  sd  qy  sd  sv  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  fc  b  sd  b  sv  sd  sv  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  ny  sd  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  qw  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  b  b  ba  sv  %  sv  aa  sd  sd  %  qo  sd  ad  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  sv  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  %  sd  bk  sd  b  sd  sd  %  fc  sd  b  b  %  sd  qy  sd  aa  sv  fc  sd  sv  sd  ba  b  b  sd  b  sv  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  fc  b^m  b  sd  nn  sd  sd  sd  sv  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  bk  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  b  sd  sd  b  aa  sv  ny  b  sd  sd  sv  sd  %  sd  %  b  %  sd  ba  sd  sd  b  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sv  %  aa  qy  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sv  qy  sd  bk  sd  sd  fa  sd  b  ba  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  fa  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  aa  sd  b  sd  sd  b  %  ad  b  sd  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  qy  b  sd  %  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sv  sd  %  b  sd  sd  b  qo  sd  qw  b  sd  b  sd  qy  sd  b  ad  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  fc  b  ba  ba  qy  sv  sd  sd  %  aa  b  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  fc  ba  sd  b  b  sd,"Cool.Alright.So you can shore up two.Awesome.Okay.""hmm"".You could shore up.these two.move and then shore up these two.Oh wait, nevermind.No.No.No.I was thinking.Oh yeah.that he was me, sorry.Yeah.Sure. This one.Hmm.So could've you.So you could do that one.and then you could do.those two.Why do you say not there?.No, you can do that one.Can you shore up the one that you're on?.Yes.Yeah? Okay.Yeah.Okay.So, that's one move to move.So, one move.And then one shore up, and then that would be considered, if you do those two at once, that would be considered.Yeah.your third move.You dont have to move to--.No, yeah. Stay on the Whispering Garden.Mhm, and then these two.Cause that just counts as one action.Sweet.Hey,.I didn't flood.Oh.Oh, well.Oh, well.It's alright.I spoke too soon.Just get it over with.Well, wait a minute. We have.cards in our dis--.That's okay. It was like that before, too.Yeah, they're supposed to be there.Yes, we don't have to put those back in.No.No?.I got it right.Ra-ra-raise.Mhm.Yup.Yup.Yeah, they do have to go back in.Yes, they do. Okay.Oh, right now. Yeah, okay.Yeah.Well.You do that first.Okay.Just gonna.And then.the water card goes over here.Just the Water Rise's one, yeah.Uh huh.And then you need to draw two.Mhm.So.Lost Lagoon.Is that, yeah go ahead.Where is that?.Nope. That's a rare.We lose it.Oh.Oh.Oh.Thankfully we didn't need it.So we need the Forgiven Island card.Mhm.Mhm.Or, no. Whatever it's called.Breaker's Bridge.Okay.And then that goes here.Not that one. Just the.Just the card.The card.Just the.Uh.Oh.blue card thing.Mhm.Okay.Okay. That's it.Cool.Alright, so let's see.(--).It's really not much.Should I move here and.do that?.Yeah.Um.And then that way.just trying to see, like.Yeah, and you're close to all of these if you need to get to them.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Okay.Umm.Maybe I should just move.here.What is your one card there?.Okay.Or, should I give.maybe I should give this to him?.Yeah.Yeah.Since I'm on the same thing.Mhm.That's so nice of you. Thank you.Here we go. No problem.And, so those are your three?.Yeah.Yeah.Alright.So, sandbags and this? Cool.And then just two of these.Phantom Rock.That's gone.And Gold Gate.Which is also at the bottom.(--).That's alright. We can do without those.Yup.Alright.That's it?.That's it, yup.Okay. Um, so I'm here.Mhm.Do I even want to do anything?.I can,.Do you wanna.I mean in terms of like trading stuff.It would pretty much be equal. I could trade but it doesn't matter.Yeah. It doesn't matter.I would keep that there then.And I think I'm in like a good central location near all of these.Yeah. Plus you're already here.So, I don't think I should do anything.Yeah.So I'll just draw my cards.Go ahead.And, oh, two of those.Cliffs of Abandon.And Whisper Garden.Alright.Well, here's my first move.I'm going to move here.And.shore up.(--).No.Oh, you could probably.That's what I was going to ask. Should I make? Because that was one and two.I can't do that on this turn.Yeah.I'll have to wait.Oh yeah, you could.So might as well wait and not.Yeah.wait until next turn to try and catch up.Yeah.Mhm.So you might as well. Yeah.Go ahead and shore up that one for my third turn.Mhm,.And here is.Cause that was originally my thought until we flooded those two.Yeah, good plan.That makes sense. Yeah.Think that's priority.So we can both get our fire cards.Okay.to the Engineer.Right.Mhm.And then I can also take your.So.lion at some point.And then I need two flood cards, please.Okay.Moved over here. So there's that. And then Iron Gate.is there.Alright.So.If you guys are gonna.Same.plan on giving that to him then he should maybe think about getting closer to there.Mhm.And I think if we all stay relatively close, I know a lot of us have cards to like give to each other.Yeah.And one nice thing, go ahead move, is.the treasures are all.Close to each other.Yeah.relatively at least these four are close together.So you still have two more moves so you could actu ally move right on there.He could move right on there.Right on there.On the.On this one.Oh, oh.Cause since you have.these two.they can plan on giving those to you.And then you can take that treasure.So then your next turn, not, yeah.Not yet though, yeah.Mhm.Okay, so.Here are two and you can only keep.One of those.How come I always get the Water Rise.Are you.Oh nevermind, he gets to keep, the one. Yes.So you have to play that one. So then that means.Yeah, so then give away.Give away the lion.(Do).Well he can keep the lion then, cause that's.Oh yeah, cause he's.then he'll only be at five anyway.Okay, yeah.Oh, cause he has to give other.Yeah, so the Water Rise's.I can give that away.Well this one, we're gonna, we have to play it right away.Mhm.So, we have to move the water up.Well you get to keep everything else though.Mhm.Alright.So we're already in the three zone here.Shuffle these up.Okay.And (--) flood cards now.Three of them.There you go.It's Whispering Garden.Oh.Temple of the Moon.Oh, no.It's gone.Sorry about that.It's okay.We have to protect that one.Yeah.Cliffs of Abandon.They're not going to go here.Alright.Alright, so.I need to think about.I could shore up.I'm definitely going to shore.these.two up.And then.I'm going to think about moving down here.Um.so maybe I'll just shore these two up.and then move here.Yeah.Okay.Yeah, sounds good.Could I.Alright, ouh.And.there we go.It's fine.Mhm.Yeah.And.three of these.Howling Garden,.where you at.Iron Gate, that's gone.And Breaker's Bridge.is flooded.Okay, that's it.Okay.So, I need to get my.fire one to the Engineer.So, he, I'm here.So one move could be helicopter.there.Mhm.And another move is giving you this. So you have to get rid of.one.You have to get rid of something, yeah.Maybe it should be the.Gold,.oh no.Maybe, no one else has any of those teal ones so maybe get rid of one of those.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Cause this, you'll probably want to keep to give to her eventually, so get rid of this one.Yeah, I'm a Leo so I have.I have problems getting rid of that lion.So am I.Good.Oh, really?.Mhm.Oh, Okay.August or July?.August.August, July.Is there one more.turn?.Yeah, I think you have one more.Oh, yeah it's my turn, I forgot it was, I thought it was his turn, okay.It's okay.Um.I don't think I should do anything. Actually, I should get closer to.explore.because.You have to make a (--) better.I have to.so I'll just get in the middle there.That works.And I know you have two of these, uh.Whoopsie.and three flood cards.Uh, Cave of Embers.Awesome.Okay.Alright.So.Where, look at your green, yeah.I'm blue.So then I'll shore up.Mhm.Breaker's Bridge, since you're on your way to me.Mhm.Um.I think just staying where I am is probably the best bet.Yeah.Oh and you should.Give that to hi--.actually.if you move here and then moved diagonally.I'll reach.you'd be ready to give, well, hm.Oh.and you don't have a helicopter, right?.Mhm.Are we saying cause then we would have to undo that shore up?.Wait a minute.It's not an important card.It's not.Yeah.Oh wait, yeah.I don't think it.Yeah, I think you should just move to him and.Give him that.Cause it, the, like the point of the game is to get the.Right.thing so it's more important.And I mean,.this.I don't know. I don't, it's not that important, yeah.So it, it could go, yeah.Yeah.So you could move one two and your third action would be to give the card to the Engineer.Right.Sounds good.And I can shore that up, too.Yeah.And there's.there.they were all (--).ehh (--).you don't need to.You don't need to get rid of your other teal card.Okay.And.And now, his turn, right?.(--).Um, we need to do flood cards.Nope. Cards. Yup.Oh yeah. Oh duh.Oh, you need these two?.I need my treasure cards.Oops.Yeah.One, to Water's Rise.Okay.Yes.Put that there.Alrighty.Three of them.Go ahead, do the honors.Alright. Whispering Garden's.Breaker's Bridge.Who all.Bye.So, since.You get to swim.I'm here.I should swim.You get to swim to.wherever you.If you swam to me, I could give you this.yeah, so.Yeah.Bam.And Howling Garden's.So Breaker's Bridge's took the tile.Oh, Howling Garden's is gone.Okay.Uh oh. We need to save Whispering Garden.Mhm.Alright.Alright.Okay. Hmm.This is definitely proving more of a challenge than last time. I mean not that it wasn't hard but yeah like it's.Oh.you have.Yeah.Little bit, yeah.Yeah.So you can turn in your four fire.Mhm.cards.and capture the treasure?.Yeah.Yup.Yup.Go get it.There you go.Alright. So that means I'm the first one to get a treasure.Yeah.Yes.Hey.So, that was just one.I get one more move.You got two more.Oh, two more?.Well.Mhm.Hmm.How about going over here.Wait, actually.actually a good move would be giving me our, our shared Leo.Right.Oh, yeah.since we're right here together this is be the best time to do that.You're right. You're right.Yeah.So, two. Yup.That could have been right. That's right.And you don't really need to do anything.Cause I mean, the two of us could shore this one.Yeah.Yeah.Cause we need to do that.Yeah.Okay.So, yeah. I think that's good.Okay. So let's just pray that it shouldn't, it's not going to be uncovered right now.Well, wait we have to do the treausre first.Oh, oh my gosh, sorry.Here are your treausre cards.Oh, i got the helicopter lift again.Nice.What's that guy.And no water rise's. Phew.And I got the Leo. Maybe I'll get a chance to give it to you.And.Alright.Okay.So, these are for you.Oh, that (--) so well.Good news is Whispering Garden is here so.Yeah that's what I was really worried about was getting another and losing that.Copper Gate.Which one is it?.Copper Gate.Copper Gate.Oh, um, no I used that one.Bye. Bye.Cave of Ember.Also, okay.Crimson Forest.That one didn't matter.Alright.Okay.We're still okay.Okay we're still good. Got it.Alright, so.I'm gonna.help this guy.Yeah.So, move one.One.two.Two.Um, and then I should move back to somebody.Ehh.Yeah.I was gonna say actually.You can move to me and I can give you this on my next turn.Your blue, yeah.Yeah. I was gonna say actually if you just keep moving, the next.turn.Yeah.then straight down.Yeah.Hurry up.So.So, trade your cards.Yup.Alright, so.Oh.Okay. This is gonna be okay.Wait,.I have these. Are we going to do anything with these?.Wait, what are these?.No. I think we've got like these and those and I don't think we're even going to use it.Nah.Alright, well then in that case.Does, yeah I think we're good so just.I'm gonna discard them because these sandbags might come in handy.Yeah.Yeah.Alright so three (of these).Dunes of Deception.Oh, I can't turn around far enough.Silver Gate.and.Cliffs of Abandon.Okay. Um, for my first move, I'll give you.this.Okay and I'm going to get rid of this.And then,.(--) that treasure.I have two more moves so I could move to Explorer and give her.Yup.Yeah.my Leo.Mhm.And then we're super set up.So you area.green.okay.Green.And there you go.And then I get rid of this.Oh good. They're the ones we don't want.Okay so Coral Place.we're okay with that.Bronze Gate.Where is that.Up there.Okay.So you can turn yours in. Oh, well you have to get to the tile. Shoot.I'm trying to think exactly.Oh you can move diagonally.Wait,.okay you're green and we need.Yeah.So you can do one two and then get that.One.Two.Yeah. Except, here's the problem with that.What?.If it floods again.and I lose either this or this, I can't get back to the landing.Okay. Um, then we should.Engineer the, oh, yeah, you're right. Okay.That's the only problem.Cause we're worried about, well.Yeah.(--) House and Cliffs of Abandon, are those in, well even if it.floods, then that would mess it up.Because then I have to survive.Should we hold off?.We might.Well you could actually go.That's right. Because I can do diagonal. Glad you thought of that.Yeah.Yeah.because we'd have to go a whole time around.Right.to wait to, um.And we're not going to lose this.Yeah.and this.Anytime soon, yeah.Right.Within one round.Mhm.So you should.So, okay, yeah.you should maybe.shore up that.Or no. Like after.Alright, that's, you only have one turn.Oh you only have one turn left. Oh yeah youre right. Sorry. Sorry sorry sorry yeah you're good.Yeah cause she had to do two moves.Right, yeah. Cause I did one, yeah.Mhm.So do that, okay. Now my two treausre cards, please.Okay, so we can do this.Don't be. Yes! No floods.Yes!.Alright and now, three flight cards.Okay.Okay. The Tower, the Watch Tower.Misty Marsh.We'll save that one, or well we can save it, it doesn't really matter.and then Temple of the Sun.which is the last one at the bottom here.Okay.Okay, so.this is where I need to get to.I think Engineer can probably get.like these two.Und--yeah.in one move.Yeah.Mhm.Say that again.You could get those two and those two. Well not that they're that important though.Actually.These ones might prove to be important, well this one because of, yeah getting to Fool's Landing so he should definitely do that.That one, mhm.That's, that's what I was thinking.Might as well.Unless we, yeah.Well, so what you want to do.Well, wait.Yeah, take that one back.Wait.Wait, cause now, our whole plan.I still can't move diagonal at this I mean if we.Let's shore these ones up.and then move.So,.pretend like we didn't move.If we shore that one and this one at least.Yup.Yeah, those like are necessities.Those two, one move.That counts as yeah and that counts as one.Yup.Yeah cause he can do two at one time.Okay.So then he could move, you could move here and shore that one up.and that would be all your moves.Cause then that way he's really close to Fool's Landing.Right.Okay.But,.There we are.oh okay.Then I'm still safe for being able even if we lose these two.Yeah.Yeah, cause you can get.I can still get out.there.Alright, we're good. Okay. Cool.That's it right? So,.Yup.Yeah.So you can, oh.you need these?.Oh god, is that a Water's Rise's?.Oh, I got a water rise. Sorry about that.It is.It's not your fault.It's alright.I got that. Another.There's a lot of cards in there so there's like not as much of a chance that you would get rid of that one.and another helicopter lift.That's good.Yeah.Okay.The first time we had two helicopters.Mhm.You do too.Oh yeah.Oh that's right cause you could always pilot me out.Yeah.If we did lose those.Mhm.Alright so three.Bronze Gate.All good.Swim.Oh.We don't care about that.No.Tidal Palace.I don't care about that either.We also don't care about that one.That won't do.(--).Water Gate.Water Gate.I just don't know. It's it's Whispering Garden.Silver Gate?.Whispering Garden.Whipsering Garden.Right.Oh, okay.I have not even.Well that's fine.Was she looking for Water Gate when I said that?.I was like, that's.That's funny. Yeah we were.Political scandal.You're like wait what.Alright, so that's it right?.Alright, yeah.Alright, so.my thing is going to be.move here so one two and then take, get that.Mhm.Yeah, perfect.And then everyone else will try to get back to Fool's Landing at this point.Yes.Yeah, okay.Okay, so.Um, wait I need to take two of these right?.We don't care about you.Watch Tower.There.Silver Gate is out.and.Dumes.of.Deception.Good.So, for me.I'm here.Mhm.Um,.I could go one, save that one and go to Fool's Landing.Or, well yeah, I could use really this.Yeah.I think that's what I would do.Yeah.Um.There we go.It doesn't really matter but I'll keep the sandbag just in case.Yeah, maybe we should use the sandbag.on that.Yeah that.Can you use that whenever?.play it anytime.Yeah.Yup.Let's do that.Well wait a minute, you've already done your moves.I think it doesn't count.Does it have to be anot--.Yeah it doesn't, does not count as an action it says.Oh, okay.So, wait.We really want this one, not that one.Sorry.Yeah cause you can move diagonally, so.Yeah.perfect.And I need three.water.cards.So, Temple of the Sun.and Misty Marsh.Oh, sorry.No, it's cool.Alright.Okay. Let's see my big two moves.One.There's one and then two.Two.You don't really need to do anything else.If I could have my two treasure cards, please.Alright,.and then three flood cards.Alright.Cave of Shadows.,.the Observatory,.and Coral Palace.Alright.I'm scared.Yeah.Okay, so, next move.You could always lift me.That's true.and it's Engineer's turn.Yeah.so he can actually get.that one.Yeah.at least.Or move one.Yeah.and then shore the one up.Oh yeah.that you're on and then.Well if he moves.to shore up.he can't move diagonally so he'd have to use two more turns to get back.Right.but we could lift him.Mhm.do you think?.Okay.I think either one would work like what are.you know.I, yeah think we really.We definitely need to save, we have so many helicopter lifts.Yeah, so let's.shore that one up, move there and then shore those two.Wait a minute.The helicopter lift, if we would use, if he would use one of those cards, could he just use it on anybody?.It says it can be played at anytime, does not count as an action.Do you need to be on the same.Tile as the person, no.no, yeah you can just move anyone from anywhere.No, it says.anyone.Yeah, so.So, if you want to, you can play.Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile.Yeah.So, how about we.you can flood.or you can, what is it called.Shore?.shore up this one.Mhm.and then with that move you get those two and then take your helicopter lift and move yourself back to Fool's L anding.Does that make sense?.So, shore up this.Yeah.then move here?.Actually, wait, back up a space.If he moves two, uses two, goes one, two.use a helicopter lift cause you can lift.Oh, lift us both there.it says lift one or more, correct?.Yeah. You can lift us both there.Yeah.Okay.Move one or more pawns on the same tile.And then we can bounce out.11 minutes.And then use that, get back here at least.So that's.and that doesn't count as an action.It does not.It does not count as an action.which is fine. Still play the next one and then we're out.Yeah.Right.There we go.So,.you you said move one, two.Mhm.and then lift us back here.Right.and then use the other helicopter to.Mhm.leave.Okay.Cool?.Oh my

Well.(Two).(Three).Okay, Whispering Garden, where's that at. Im on it. What do I have to do, slide--.What if, am I, am I flooded.Good thing we lifted him.And.Temple of the Moon.and then Cliffs of Abandon.There it is.My turn? Alright.Yeah.I'm gonna--.Doesn't, wait does the helicopter count as a turn?.No.So if you move here.um helicopter with me over here.and give him.one of those.then we could get that on the next turn as long as we don't.draw it.Do you see what I'm saying.Yeah, let's do that.Move you.And we are.giving this.to you.Then I have to get rid of one right away.Oh yeah, get rid of this because we're together.And I'm using sandbag.Cause I can give it to you anytime.(--).I'm gonna use a sandbag to get this thing out.And.Temple of the Sun, Crimson Forest, and Breaker's Bridge.Temple of the Sun.Okay, so.I'll give you this one.Okay.and you have to discard one.Um.I already have two of these so.Yeah.if you, well if you discard.this one, we won't lose out on this chance.Yeah.Umm.then.Umm then I'll move.here.Then (--).Oh, you already gave it to him?.Yeah.Okay.Here and shore this.and then I'll return.One, two, three, four.Now so two of those.Three of these.Silver Gate, Tidal Palace, and Copper Gate.Silver Gate is here.Tidal Palace and Copper Gate, okay.Put these on the top, then your turn.Umm.Well I have four of these, can I give that.Alright.and then.we just put these here.And then if you.that takes one action.if you trade this one to me.Oh yeah that's good.then.That's another action.Then I have one more.Can I move.up.as an action.Yeah.Yeah.Alright.Then I'll get two of these.These things are floating all over the place.(Lagoon Bay).Oh, goodness gracious.Oh, goodie.Oh, good.And now, I guess.It's (so sweet) right now.three of these.(--).Well this isn't really useful.Where's Bronze Gate at?.Bronze Gate's over here.Okay.Like is there a Cave of Shadows.That's right here.And Dumes of Deception.Did they say (no).Alright.Yeah I think it'll help.You could focus on the shoring.You could focus on the shore like just move anywhere.Yeah that's what I'm thinking.So, I will.I'll flip here.flip this over.Can you flip over an adjacent one or not?.Yeah.And I guess flip here and flip.I think he means that he had flew up there instead.Instead, instead of flying up here, I'll fly up here.as a replacement.Sorry.Umm.and then.draw cards.Misty Marsh, Howling Garden, Cave of.Embers.No more flooding.More flooding.Howling Garden.Where's that cave.Cave of Embers?.Yeah.You already did that.Yeah.Misty Marsh is right here.Okay, so.Uhh.Move here.Aren't you tryna.uh this one's just as good though.Oh yeah yeah.

I'm over here so.I'd put the two places besides you.Here and here?.Or here?.Well, shore them up.rather than flip them.then moving.That way we don't lose more cards.No I mean,.when you're here you can shore these two up.You don't need to move I don't think.Alright this is that one and this one too?.Okay and.is that two moves? Okay.That's true.Yeah.You could start making your way to.Well I give you, you have four, I have four.I already have four so.I yeah what he's saying. You could start moving up here.So I'll, I guess, okay I'll move here.Then I'll get two of these.I don't know why I get these. It makes me mad. It goes up from.Happens to someone eventually.And maybe we have to shuffle these.That goes there and then we have to shuffle these up.or put them on top.Yeah.And then, and then.we have these so then I have to get three of these.One.two three.Dumes of Deception.Dumes of Deception.Misty Marsh.and then Howling Garden.Okay.Now that one goes there, hm.So then your turn?.Oh it's my turn.Umm.I'm thinking I'll move here.fly here, transport him up here.and then this way we can go down,.Yeah.someone can fly here.use this card.transport us both here.I'm getting out of this place.and (--) to.Alright.Copper Gate, Bronze Gate, Cave of Shadows.Bronze Gate,.Copper Gate,.and what was the last one?.Cave of Shadows.It's flood time.Okay,.So.I'll.move here.trade the four.for this.and then.use the last one to move here.and then two of those.You could just use your card and be done.Oh is this not a.doesn't count as an action, okay.so.game.Are we done?

I have another the lift card and that's--.Do I take the flood cards now?.Gold Gate and Temple of the Moon..Golden Gate (we lost gold.).And then.save yourself..Okay.I'm gonna.should I try and collect these?.Yeah..Yeah..Okay..So I'm gonna start by.shoring up these two..What do you think? Because we don't really need this one in the end but I feel like we still need these two like(--)..Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..And then I'll move.to you so you can give me that on your turn..Oh, yeah..And then I guess I'll just.hangout there..We're on the same island..Can I have two,.thanks..Oh yay, a third..Okay then it's five so I need two of these..Whispering Garden and Iron Gate..Whispering Garden..Yeah..Right up there..Okay..Your turn..Okay so I'm assuming we're probably all going to go.water, I'm probably gonna go wind after wind and you're probably going to (--)..Maybe (--) here.Yeah eventually..Okay, so I guess my three actions are on the, towards the.a wind Island..I might go.one.and then.flip this as a two.and not move anywhere I guess because.we're.just in case I need to reach back out to you guys..I'm trying to think..Oh actually maybe I should've.Hmm..(-- there's nothing really I can do).Should I use this?.You have two, you have two options. You could either.I mean you could move here.or you could move here and then make your way to there on your next turn..Just to.just in case, you know, either of uh any of us get one of those and then pass it on to you..Yeah..That's just my suggestion..But, but you could also.I mean I don't think it really matters.cause either way, if I.if either of us move here we can just pass you whatever card.so.or.no.cause I'm close. Because I'm, I still need to give her that..And then she needs to.go.(-- rock)..So that the rock and the fire all are really close to each other, that's what we're all trying to get, right?

Wait, (Iron --)..Iron Gate, oh wait..I already got rid of it..(--) oh I'm sorry..Yeah but that card..So..So do you want to give me..First let me.Okay..shore this up.then I'll give you this..Do I have to discard something so what should I.should I go with.I would probably,.let me see.I'm going to go with this one because we already got three rocks out right now..Okay, that's fine..It's still your turn red..Or is it.No I had to do that because you gave me a card so it's your turn. You have one more move because you shored up and then you gave me a card and then you have one more move..Okay, uh.I think um.oh yeah I can move somewhere else, um.I think I'll just stay there.cause I have these..Okay so (bags) and this bad boy..And then three of these..(--)..Got three..Temple of the Moon.Whispering Garden.and Breaker's Bridge..It's right there..Alright so I'm gonna go.one.two and then.three..And then I get.two treasures.Oh, on. One second..Okay..Before we go on to the next turn is there anything.that's really really at risk that we don't want to lose..I would.Probably not want to lose this..um.Just so, cause in the event, you know,.some Temple of the Moon card comes up again..Okay..Yeah..I don't, we don't want to all travel all the way over here or something like that..Okay..I'm trying to think because,.where are you right now?.Me?.I'll answer..Oh you're right there, okay..So.Oh maybe you should (--)..because.probably would have to save that one.Yeah..because you're closest to that one compared to.you know, going all the way over here. Oh but at the same time.cause you're right here, I would.move towards her so she can give you that.and then you can just, I would probably get rid of the red one.Well he's, he just wants to know if we should save anything before I draw these cards..Yeah..Oh, oh save anything, umm..Yeah cause these two are in danger and they're like in our vacinity..I would, I'd save Whispering Garden..Alright, well I'll save Whispering Garden for one.and then do, in the event she draws a Temple of, do you think that the odds of her drawing a Temple of the Moon.um.I can s--.do we need to save that?.Is there a Fool's Landing sink card?.Like a.Fool's Landing can sink too.Okay, yeah..But it's not, I mean we could always go to this one..Yeah it should be fine..Yeah I guess we know where she (--)..Okay..Temple of the sun.Crimson Forest.Crimson..and Copper Gate..Okay..Now it's my turn..No, cause I just went so it's your turn..Oh..Take it to three actions..So, um..You're here..Yeah I might as well go back to one of you guys..Or I could, I can.I'm right here..Or I might as well save some things while I'm here, right?.Oh, that's right..Hmm..Well if you go here.she can trade you that on her turn and you can save that one..Yeah..So first I go here.then I'll.save.You can't trade until it's your turn though..save this.Okay..and.what.who wants to start collecting or who wants to start doing our rocks..Rocks.You only gave me one because I have I have like open.Yeah..Yeah..that way you don't have to discard anything..Yeah..Uh okay now.draw.That, I think that's your three turns..Got another Water Rise card..Do you want to save anything before?.No it should be fine cause if we lose Temple of the Sun we still have Temple of the Moon.and the Gardens are fine..That's what we'll go for next..One,.two,.three..Crimson Forest..Is null and void..Whispering Garden..This must be the garden that's always in danger..and the Copper Gate..And Copper Gate, oh..Bye-bye..Okay..Should I give you this?.Oh, wait..I (--) as soon as you return..Yeah, do..Okay..I.I'm trying to think..Hmm..Oh wait, I can just go over there..Right?.I can go over there and just shore it up myself..Yeah I gu--.yeah you can..Yeah..Good idea..And then cause I don't need to.cause I don't need to pass anything yet..So that was two, right?.That was two and then I guess I'll just.You should fly somewhere else..I'll just.You have (--)..I'll just make way onto (--) back here just in case..Oh wait, uh..Oh yeah one turn I did my bad, okay..And then I'll just, I'll just go down here..Okay..So (--)..Okay..I'm probably.we.you know what.What do you have in your other hand?.Oh yeah we have to discard..This is a helicopter lift..Oh..I'm going to s--.Oh sorry..One two three four, no cause I have five..Well you can use one of them if you want to like lift me.to.I, but do the rules say that we have to immediately discard..Yeah..So is she allowed to use, she can't use like sandbag before she discards I'm assuming. It says use anytime but the rules also say.Yeah I have to..Oh, I don't know..discard immediately..I think you could use it.in the process of discarding it..That's..Umm..Where you, I don't think.I think lifts are, I.Well discarding it is like using it..Lifts are more important. I think with your ability to fly places now, the sandbags might not be as big of an option cause you can always just fly somewhere and save it, right?.Yeah. I can just sacrifice a sandbag.it's fine..Umm,.is that it?.I was going to say you could fly me to here.with helicopter lift so that I can give him this.Okay..and then that way I can also move to you and give you like one of these..Okay..Instead of wasting two actions like moving here and then moving here..Yeah..Okay..Okay..Instead of discarding the sandbags you could.discard a helicopter lift..Okay..Okay..Wait.discard.Like take the sandbags back right now and discard helicopter lift and.and just dicard.like use it..Okay..Like in discarding use it and I and then fly..I'd be there..Does that make sense?.Okay..Yeah okay, that's fine..Yeah..Okay..So I should.before you.did we already do the flood thing?.No I think you still have to draw the three floods..No.So.before we do that you might as well just use your sandbag.to save something just in case?.I mean the only thing that's really in danger is that and we can always.Oh..just use this and we're all over here anyway so it'd be easy to save it..Okay..Yeah..Makes sense..I think we'll be okay..Okay so then you need three of these..Breaker's Bridge is null and void..Temple of the Moon.and Cliff's, it's always the one that we're standing on..Okay..Okay so first I'm going to give you.this..I thank you..And then you have too many now though so you have to discard one..Lose that one because we already have this..Yeah..And then I'm.okay so what should I do next. I could either save these two.or I could go to you and give you one of these but that would be two moves. Like if I save these two I still have one move left..What's your ability?.I can save two at a time..I would probably save those two..Save them,.okay..Cause we could drown..And then should I stay here or should I move?.Umm..I can like move here and then you can fly to me..Yeah, that's fine..Okay..Okay so I need two treasure, please..Oh well..And um three of these..Okay, Temple of the Sun,.uh Tidal Palace,.and Silver Gate..Okay..Okay..(So if).So it's your turn..We can, we can probably finish this up really really quickly..Yeah..Umm.so I can do.two actions.umm.I guess I should.should I just move two and capture that one?.I mean you can fly him there.Yeah..and then that way you can give me the fourth.And then someone.red thing..Yeah..Like you can fly him there and then you'll trade those in and then give me the fourth..Okay..Okay..Do you want me to use it now..Yeah..Yeah sure..Okay..So,.who (--)..I'm being flown here, I haven't used any actions yet but now I'm using one action to.get the wind..Then I still have two actions left so I should.Yeah..can give one to somebody.Okay..Okay then I'll discard one of these..And you should make your way to Fool's Landing..And.I'll make my way to Fool's Landing..Yeah..Don't forget your treasure cards..Oh.that's important..And now.Three..Oh no..(--).(--)..Bronze Gate.Bronze.Gate..Cave of Shadows.and Dumes of Deception..Alright, your turn..Okay..What am I gonna do..Umm..(Do you have any).do you want me to.oh wait, because you already have.Yeah so I'm.cause we cause we only need one more..Yeah on my turn I'm gonna go like here here and then trade them in..Yeah..Okay..I could just make my way to Fool's Landing, I mean I could just.You might, well you could fly somewhere and then save that in the meantime cause we're gonna have to draw flood cards right so..be right there..Yeah..Oh yeah yeah yeah okay..Yeah..I'm gonna go here.and then save this.and then.and I'll just stick there..Sure..Okay, it's fine..We're not gonna need this..Okay, three flood cards..Okay, Misty Marsh.Wait, didn't, okay..Misty Marsh, Howling Garden.and then Cave of Embers is right here..Okay, so I'm gonna go.one, two and then trade these in.for this..Okay..Now I'm done. Oh wait I need the two treasure--.Wait, um..That was my three moves..Okay..Two or three?.Wait, so I have Water's Rises.Before we do that.I'm gonna use a sandbag to--.Yeah.to save it, yeah..Just so there is no complications. We know we're going to have to draw from the top anyways, so..Oh wait..Okay so three, one, two, three..Okay, Tidal Palace.Temple of the Sun.Temple of the Sun..Maybe we already.Do we wanna get rid of that one?.Think we.Yeah.probably..Okay..I think we (just should).And then Howling Garden..Howling Garden is null and void, okay..Okay..Yeah, okay..Uh, Bronze Gate..Okay..Okay..So..Oh, you..Okay..(--) Um, three actions. Um we already have all of our pieces right?.Just make your way here.Yeah..and then I'll use the-.Okay..And then I can lift us out..So,.one,.two, three..Yeah..Yeah..And then I'll use this to take us over here..And then I'll use this to.No..free us..Play fast.",s,ad  %  sd  sd  %  sd  b  b  nn  b  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  fa  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  %  bf  sd  sd  qo  bf  %  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  %  sv  b  sd  sd  sd  aa  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sd  sd  qw  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  ad  sd  sv  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  ad  b  sd  qy  b  b  b  sd  sd  sv  b  b  b  sd  ad  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  ^h  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  %  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  qy  sv  sv  ad  %  sd  b  sv  sd  sv  %  sd  %  %  nn  sd  sd  %  %  sd  sd  %  b  b  sd  b  b  qy  sd  %  %  sd  sd  b^m  fc  sd  sd  sv  fc  sd  sd  sd  fa  sd  %  ad  sd  b  ad  sd  sd  qy  sd  ^h  sd  bk  sv  %  sd  b  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  qy  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  qw  sd  %  aa  %  ad  %  sv  b  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  sd  qy  %  sd  qy  qy  %  sd  b  sd  sv  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  b  sd  %  sd  fc  sd  sd  sd  aa  b  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  %  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  sd  %  sv  sd  qy  sv  sd  sd  %  sd  sd  sd  qy  sd  sv  sd  sd  fc  b  qy  ba  fc  b  b  %  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  aa  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  %  b  sd  %  %  qw  sd  sd  b  sd  fa  sd  sd  %  qy  b  sd  sd  h  sd  sv  sd  %  %  sd  sd  sd  sv  sd  sd  %  qy  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  b  b  sv  sd  b  b  %  sd  sd  %  %  b  sd  sd  qy  b  aa  b  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  nn  %  sd  sd  sv  b  ad  b  b  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  ba  fc  sd  sv  b  %  sd  sd  qw  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  %  sd  aa  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  %  sv  sv  b  %  sd  sd  %  sd  qy  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  b  qy  b  b  b  %  qw  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sv  %  sd  b  sd  b  sv  %  sd  ba  %  %  sd  b^m  %  sd  sd  ad  b  sd  %  qy  ^q  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  sd  b  b  b  sd  sd  %  sd  b  fc  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  b  sd  b  sd  sd  sd  sd  b  sd  sd  ba  sd  sd  sd  sd  sd  qy  %  b  aa  b  sv  sd  sd  b  b  sd  b  b  %  ba  b  sd  ad  b  sd  b  sd  %  sd  sd  b  b  sd  sd  nn  sd  sd,"Okay, go first.Um,.any suggestions?.I'm thinking move here and then shore up these.or.we could do these two and then move here and then do these two.Okay.Hmm.No.Okay.Anything else?.No I think that's it.Okay so two of those-.Water's rises.So, Phantom Rock and Lost Lagoon.And this gives-.Need Phantom and Rock, need Phantom Rock.Oh, sorry.too.And then this gets a discard.Oh and this goes up.Okay.So, I'm done.Alright.um.this is (--).Move.here.and then.why not-.Move.towards.I'm trying to think because.because right now we're closest to getting either.either of these two.

Two.Two.Didn't you shuffle this first?.No it's only in (--).Cliff's of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge.Oh the one I'm on.Where's the other one.Cliffs of Abandon,.I'm standing on that one.Okay,.umm.at least for now, I'll just move towards you.and then.shore this up.and then.that's really it.Okay, can you move again though?.You move up--.Yeah, I, I can.What do, oh yeah (it's your turn) anyways I guess yeah it's not until your turn anyways.Yeah it doesn't really make much of a difference. I have another the lift card and that's--.Do I take the flood cards now?.Gold Gate and Temple of the Moon.Golden Gate (we lost gold.).And then.save yourself.Okay.I'm gonna.should I try and collect these?.Yeah.Yeah.Okay.So I'm gonna start by.shoring up these two.What do you think? Because we don't really need this one in the end but I feel like we still need these two like(--).Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.And then I'll move.to you so you can give me that on your turn.Oh, yeah.And then I guess I'll just.hangout there.We're on the same island.Can I have two,.thanks.Oh yay, a third.Okay then it's five so I need two of these.Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.Whispering Garden.Yeah.Right up there.Okay.Your turn.Okay so I'm assuming we're probably all going to go.water, I'm probably gonna go wind after wind and you're probably going to (--).Maybe (--) here.Yeah eventually.Okay, so I guess my three actions are on the, towards the.a wind Island.I might go.one.and then.flip this as a two.and not move anywhere I guess because.we're.just in case I need to reach back out to you guys.I'm trying to think.Oh actually maybe I should've.Hmm.(-- there's nothing really I can do).Should I use this?.You have two, you have two options. You could either.I mean you could move here.or you could move here and then make your way to there on your next turn.Just to.just in case, you know, either of uh any of us get one of those and then pass it on to you.Yeah.That's just my suggestion.But, but you could also.I mean I don't think it really matters.cause either way, if I.if either of us move here we can just pass you whatever card.so.or.no.cause I'm close. Because I'm, I still need to give her that.And then she needs to.go.(-- rock).So that the rock and the fire all are really close to each other, that's what we're all trying to get, right? So if we all stay close to each other I guess we can all continue trading and.(Going there).here or there?.Yeah.Yeah just.yeah just yeah just stay close.Yeah.Okay.Did you get your treasure cards.Water Rise.Uhh.One,.Two,.Three.Iron Gate,.Bye-bye.Cliffs of Abandon.and Lost Lagoon.Well you're in Lost, oh.Adios.Oh yeah that one. Wait, (Iron --).Iron Gate, oh wait.I already got rid of it.(--) oh I'm sorry.Yeah but that card.So.So do you want to give me.First let me.Okay.shore this up.then I'll give you this.Do I have to discard something so what should I.should I go with.I would probably,.let me see.I'm going to go with this one because we already got three rocks out right now.Okay, that's fine.It's still your turn red.Or is it.No I had to do that because you gave me a card so it's your turn. You have one more move because you shored up and then you gave me a card and then you have one more move.Okay, uh.I think um.oh yeah I can move somewhere else, um.I think I'll just stay there.cause I have these.Okay so (bags) and this bad boy.And then three of these.(--).Got three.Temple of the Moon.Whispering Garden.and Breaker's Bridge.It's right there.Alright so I'm gonna go.one.two and then.three.And then I get.two treasures.Oh, on. One second.Okay.Before we go on to the next turn is there anything.that's really really at risk that we don't want to lose.I would.Probably not want to lose this.um.Just so, cause in the event, you know,.some Temple of the Moon card comes up again.Okay.Yeah.I don't, we don't want to all travel all the way over here or something like that.Okay.I'm trying to think because,.where are you right now?.Me?.I'll answer.Oh you're right there, okay.So.Oh maybe you should (--).because.probably would have to save that one.Yeah.because you're closest to that one compared to.you know, going all the way over here. Oh but at the same time.cause you're right here, I would.move towards her so she can give you that.and then you can just, I would probably get rid of the red one.Well he's, he just wants to know if we should save anything before I draw these cards.Yeah.Oh, oh save anything, umm.Yeah cause these two are in danger and they're like in our vacinity.I would, I'd save Whispering Garden.Alright, well I'll save Whispering Garden for one.and then do, in the event she draws a Temple of, do you think that the odds of her drawing a Temple of the Moon.um.I can s--.do we need to save that?.Is there a Fool's Landing sink card?.Like a.Fool's Landing can sink too.Okay, yeah.But it's not, I mean we could always go to this one.Yeah it should be fine.Yeah I guess we know where she (--).Okay.Temple of the sun.Crimson Forest.Crimson.and Copper Gate.Okay.Now it's my turn.No, cause I just went so it's your turn.Oh.Take it to three actions.So, um.You're here.Yeah I might as well go back to one of you guys.Or I could, I can.I'm right here.Or I might as well save some things while I'm here, right?.Oh, that's right.Hmm.Well if you go here.she can trade you that on her turn and you can save that one.Yeah.So first I go here.then I'll.save.You can't trade until it's your turn though.save this.Okay.and.what.who wants to start collecting or who wants to start doing our rocks.Rocks.You only gave me one because I have I have like open.Yeah.Yeah.that way you don't have to discard anything.Yeah.Uh okay now.draw.That, I think that's your three turns.Got another Water Rise card.Do you want to save anything before?.No it should be fine cause if we lose Temple of the Sun we still have Temple of the Moon.and the Gardens are fine.That's what we'll go for next.One,.two,.three.Crimson Forest.Is null and void.Whispering Garden.This must be the garden that's always in danger.and the Copper Gate.And Copper Gate, oh.Bye-bye.Okay.Should I give you this?.Oh, wait.I (--) as soon as you return.Yeah, do.Okay.I.I'm trying to think.Hmm.Oh wait, I can just go over there.Right?.I can go over there and just shore it up myself.Yeah I gu--.yeah you can.Yeah.Good idea.And then cause I don't need to.cause I don't need to pass anything yet.So that was two, right?.That was two and then I guess I'll just.You should fly somewhere else.I'll just.You have (--).I'll just make way onto (--) back here just in case.Oh wait, uh.Oh yeah one turn I did my bad, okay.And then I'll just, I'll just go down here.Okay.So (--).Okay.I'm probably.we.you know what.What do you have in your other hand?.Oh yeah we have to discard.This is a helicopter lift.Oh.I'm going to s--.Oh sorry.One two three four, no cause I have five.Well you can use one of them if you want to like lift me.to.I, but do the rules say that we have to immediately discard.Yeah.So is she allowed to use, she can't use like sandbag before she discards I'm assuming. It says use anytime but the rules also say.Yeah I have to.Oh, I don't know.discard immediately.I think you could use it.in the process of discarding it.That's.Umm.Where you, I don't think.I think lifts are, I.Well discarding it is like using it.Lifts are more important. I think with your ability to fly places now, the sandbags might not be as big of an option cause you can always just fly somewhere and save it, right?.Yeah. I can just sacrifice a sandbag.it's fine.Umm,.is that it?.I was going to say you could fly me to here.with helicopter lift so that I can give him this.Okay.and then that way I can also move to you and give you like one of these.Okay.Instead of wasting two actions like moving here and then moving here.Yeah.Okay.Okay.Instead of discarding the sandbags you could.discard a helicopter lift.Okay.Okay.Wait.discard.Like take the sandbags back right now and discard helicopter lift and.and just dicard.like use it.Okay.Like in discarding use it and I and then fly.I'd be there.Does that make sense?.Okay.Yeah okay, that's fine.Yeah.Okay.So I should.before you.did we already do the flood thing?.No I think you still have to draw the three floods.No.So.before we do that you might as well just use your sandbag.to save something just in case?.I mean the only thing that's really in danger is that and we can always.Oh.just use this and we're all over here anyway so it'd be easy to save it.Okay.Yeah.Makes sense.I think we'll be okay.Okay so then you need three of these.Breaker's Bridge is null and void.Temple of the Moon.and Cliff's, it's always the one that we're standing on.Okay.Okay so first I'm going to give you.this.I thank you.And then you have too many now though so you have to discard one.Lose that one because we already have this.Yeah.And then I'm.okay so what should I do next. I could either save these two.or I could go to you and give you one of these but that would be two moves. Like if I save these two I still have one move left.What's your ability?.I can save two at a time.I would probably save those two.Save them,.okay.Cause we could drown.And then should I stay here or should I move?.Umm.I can like move here and then you can fly to me.Yeah, that's fine.Okay.Okay so I need two treasure, please.Oh well.And um three of these.Okay, Temple of the Sun,.uh Tidal Palace,.and Silver Gate.Okay.Okay.(So if).So it's your turn.We can, we can probably finish this up really really quickly.Yeah.Umm.so I can do.two actions.umm.I guess I should.should I just move two and capture that one?.I mean you can fly him there.Yeah.and then that way you can give me the fourth.And then someone.red thing.Yeah.Like you can fly him there and then you'll trade those in and then give me the fourth.Okay.Okay.Do you want me to use it now.Yeah.Yeah sure.Okay.So,.who (--).I'm being flown here, I haven't used any actions yet but now I'm using one action to.get the wind.Then I still have two actions left so I should.Yeah.can give one to somebody.Okay.Okay then I'll discard one of these.And you should make your way to Fool's Landing.And.I'll make my way to Fool's Landing.Yeah.Don't forget your treasure cards.Oh.that's important.And now.Three.Oh no.(--).(--).Bronze Gate.Bronze.Gate.Cave of Shadows.and Dumes of Deception.Alright, your turn.Okay.What am I gonna do.Umm.(Do you have any).do you want me to.oh wait, because you already have.Yeah so I'm.cause we cause we only need one more.Yeah on my turn I'm gonna go like here here and then trade them in.Yeah.Okay.I could just make my way to Fool's Landing, I mean I could just.You might, well you could fly somewhere and then save that in the meantime cause we're gonna have to draw flood cards right so.be right there.Yeah.Oh yeah yeah yeah okay.Yeah.I'm gonna go here.and then save this.and then.and I'll just stick there.Sure.Okay, it's fine.We're not gonna need this.Okay, three flood cards.Okay, Misty Marsh.Wait, didn't, okay.Misty Marsh, Howling Garden.and then Cave of Embers is right here.Okay, so I'm gonna go.one, two and then trade these in.for this.Okay.Now I'm done. Oh wait I need the two treasure--.Wait, um.That was my three moves.Okay.Two or three?.Wait, so I have Water's Rises.Before we do that.I'm gonna use a sandbag to--.Yeah.to save it, yeah.Just so there is no complications. We know we're going to have to draw from the top anyways, so.Oh wait.Okay so three, one, two, three.Okay, Tidal Palace.Temple of the Sun.Temple of the Sun.Maybe we already.Do we wanna get rid of that one?.Think we.Yeah.probably.Okay.I think we (just should).And then Howling Garden.Howling Garden is null and void, okay.Okay.Yeah, okay.Uh, Bronze Gate.Okay.Okay.So.Oh, you.Okay.(--) Um, three actions. Um we already have all of our pieces right?.Just make your way here.Yeah.and then I'll use the-.Okay.And then I can lift us out.So,.one,.two, three.Yeah.Yeah.And then I'll use this to take us over here.And then I'll use this to.No.free us.Play fast. ad  %  sd  sd  %  sd  b  b  nn  b  qy  sd  sd  sd  sd  %  sd  fa  %  sd  sd  b  sd  b  %  %  bf  sd  sd  qo  bf  %  sd  sd  sv  sv  sd  %  sv  b

Okay okay..so that was a helicopter because.Oh yeah yeah!.you can't move diagonally..It was a helicopter..Yeah wait wait let's--.Yeah..Okay. It doesn't matter I have a helicopter too..Wait wait wait. Wait one second. So you can use a helicopter and move here.and then you have to use.and then she can take her helicopter and move you guys here but you have.someone has to get me there too..We need to get you there..Well yeah..No no no wait. Oh yeah..So you.Why don't.So can I okay..We would have to wait for your turn again so some--.Like uh..Wait. Uh..Okay..I get it. Okay. That's fine..Why don't you helicopter--.Okay so I've only did one action and that's this card..Okay so you want to helicopter yourself..So you wait wait..Your thing is not an action..Can I see that really quick?.Oh yeah..Yeah..This card..It's not an action..Move one or more.One or more pawns at the same time..pawns on the same tile to any other tile. Okay so yeah you can move yourself onto this tile..And then--.Right?.Or what about we move these two to.I.I was just gonna say,.To Fool's Landing?.to Fool's Landing..Yeah (--)..Yeah..Yeah I think you guys should go here..Helicopter.helicopter her here..Okay we have total three helicopters..We have three so we'll be fine..But I think you should get you two to the Fool's Landing..Get as many together as possible..Okay do you guys wanna move..Yeah..Oh wait wait wait. Wait hold on hold on hold on..If I hm.uh.if I move, if I fly myself here.can I give you this other card?.No..No..No. Crap..You have to wait for--. You can use that anytime you want so right after--.Well.It's okay you can use that anytime though..Well I thought I--.I know but.this is Pilot right?.but we gotta we have to get to Flood's Landing because.Pilot can go anytime on her own..Oh you know what we can do. Wait wait wait no no no this is not a problem at all. You can use one card, fly yourself. Then you can use the other card card and fly me and then you can use your card and fly yourself..Okay..Yeah..It doesn't matter. That does not it doesn't matter in turn..Yeah..Yeah..Mhm..So I can so I'm using both these cards. That's.So that's it. Yeah..Yeah..Okay..That's it. So we're all here..If I use--. No yeah yeah okay. That makes sense..Do you not, I mean games over. That's it..And then we're out..Then we're done..Then done..Right..No..No?.Yeah..Wait (which).That's not right..You don't think so?.Well you're allowed, maybe you're not allowed to use both of those in one turn..Uh maybe--.Okay okay let's try this again..Okay..No cause here..Wait we have tw--.I was here. I was--.Two here..And I was up here..Okay..Okay..Uh..So I think that--.Okay just.just I guess come on here. One person come on here..Just put one of you..So use you--.No I'd have to use a lift to get there because I can't move diagonally..Okay..Yeah just use it..Oh you want to get yourself on here. Okay..Just get yourself.Okay..Yeah get yourself here..Get yourself here..And--.So that's done..Which why can't you just go here?.So I, but the question is can I use this card. Can I use can I do two--.You can use that whenever you want..You can use that right now if you want..Okay cause that's what we did before..What?.Well then what did we, then what did we do wrong?.Right and so well let's see let's do it slower..So use cause you can use that out of turn it doesn't matter..Who is this? You?.That's me..Wait. Okay..Uh..Look that's not an action so you can use them whenever..Alright..I think..Everyone must move their pawn oh.Okay so then we'll move all three of us here..That's what we did before..Okay..Okay..And we'll get rid of this.Okay..We oh we need one helicopter card to get off the island..Mhm..Okay and then.We can't..Oh..I have one but the thing is I can't move you here. I can't move you here..You need to save it..Okay so you can't move me. Okay that's that's what I don't want..Okay so you moved yourself here so I'm stuck..We c--.I can just shore that up and move..Okay but can I use this to move you?.Yeah and then we would all have to go one more turn to move one by one. We can do that..We can't..Pilot.get us over to Flood's Landing..No..I can only move myself..That's true. Okay..But with your helicopter lift card we need that to get off the island..But we need one to get off. Yeah..Alright..Okay so use the other to get me.Never gotten this far before..Well yeah I mean.No no no look this is this good cause all we're all going to be here and then we just use our turn our action..Okay..Yeah,.we each we each can move there when we get our turn..Hm..Yeah..Okay..Okay..We just need to get.So we're just going to move you here.Mhm..with that helicopter card..Alright..Mhm..So it's my turn..Then this one gets us off the island..Yeah..Oh no I have to pick um.Flood?.I have to finish my turn..Oh right..Oh gosh. I forgot about--.And here's the issue.

Shoot.Oh.Go go.I can't move diagonally.Mh mh.Wait no no no just use your helicopter move to her.Just wait.What color are you?.She's green.I'm the green.What about is this you?.Yeah.Yes wait.What about you move to where she is and give her a card.Give her your red card.Well why?.Okay wait let me move.Okay I'm moving. I'm helicopter.We just need a three to win.Hm?.I just did it.We just need three to win.You need four to win.No you just need three of the four.Three.We need three of the--.Oh so we--.So we, we just have to get here.Wait.Oh!.Yeah we just need three of the treasures.So they don't, so now that--.Oh. Okay okay.so that was a helicopter because.Oh yeah yeah!.you can't move diagonally.It was a helicopter.Yeah wait wait let's--.Yeah.Okay. It doesn't matter I have a helicopter too.Wait wait wait. Wait one second. So you can use a helicopter and move here.and then you have to use.and then she can take her helicopter and move you guys here but you have.someone has to get me there too.We need to get you there.Well yeah.No no no wait. Oh yeah.So you.Why don't.So can I okay.We would have to wait for your turn again so some--.Like uh.Wait. Uh.Okay.I get it. Okay. That's fine.Why don't you helicopter--.Okay so I've only did one action and that's this card.Okay so you want to helicopter yourself.So you wait wait.Your thing is not an action.Can I see that really quick?.Oh yeah.Yeah.This card.It's not an action.Move one or more.One or more pawns at the same time.pawns on the same tile to any other tile. Okay so yeah you can move yourself onto this tile.And then--.Right?.Or what about we move these two to.I.I was just gonna say,.To Fool's Landing?.to Fool's Landing.Yeah (--).Yeah.Yeah I think you guys should go here.Helicopter.helicopter her here.Okay we have total three helicopters.We have three so we'll be fine.But I think you should get you two to the Fool's Landing.Get as many together as possible.Okay do you guys wanna move.Yeah.Oh wait wait wait. Wait hold on hold on hold on.If I hm.uh.if I move, if I fly myself here.can I give you this other card?.No.No.No. Crap.You have to wait for--. You can use that anytime you want so right after--.Well.It's okay you can use that anytime though.Well I thought I--.I know but.this is Pilot right?.but we gotta we have to get to Flood's Landing because.Pilot can go anytime on her own.Oh you know what we can do. Wait wait wait no no no this is not a problem at all. You can use one card, fly yourself. Then you can use the other card card and fly me and then you can use your card and fly yourself.Okay.Yeah.It doesn't matter. That does not it doesn't matter in turn.Yeah.Yeah.Mhm.So I can so I'm using both these cards. That's.So that's it. Yeah.Yeah.Okay.That's it. So we're all here.If I use--. No yeah yeah okay. That makes sense.Do you not, I mean games over. That's it.And then we're out.Then we're done.Then done.Right.No.No?.Yeah.Wait (which).That's not right.You don't think so?.Well you're allowed, maybe you're not allowed to use both of those in one turn.Uh maybe--.Okay okay let's try this again.Okay.No cause here.Wait we have tw--.I was here. I was--.Two here.And I was up here.Okay.Okay.Uh.So I think that--.Okay just.just I guess come on here. One person come on here.Just put one of you.So use you--.No I'd have to use a lift to get there because I can't move diagonally.Okay.Yeah just use it.Oh you want to get yourself on here. Okay.Just get yourself.Okay.Yeah get yourself here.Get yourself here.And--.So that's done.Which why can't you just go here?.So I, but the question is can I use this card. Can I use can I do two--.You can use that whenever you want.You can use that right now if you want.Okay cause that's what we did before.What?.Well then what did we, then what did we do wrong?.Right and so well let's see let's do it slower.So use cause you can use that out of turn it doesn't matter.Who is this? You?.That's me.Wait. Okay.Uh.Look that's not an action so you can use them whenever.Alright.I think.Everyone must move their pawn oh.Okay so then we'll move all three of us here.That's what we did before.Okay.Okay.And we'll get rid of this.Okay.We oh we need one helicopter card to get off the island.Mhm.Okay and then.We can't.Oh.I have one but the thing is I can't move you here. I can't move you here.You need to save it.Okay so you can't move me. Okay that's that's what I don't want.Okay so you moved yourself here so I'm stuck.We c--.I can just shore that up and move.Okay but can I use this to move you?.Yeah and then we would all have to go one more turn to move one by one. We can do that.We can't.Pilot.get us over to Flood's Landing.No.I can only move myself.That's true. Okay.But with your helicopter lift card we need that to get off the island.But we need one to get off. Yeah.Alright.Okay so use the other to get me.Never gotten this far before.Well yeah I mean.No no no look this is this good cause all we're all going to be here and then we just use our turn our action.Okay.Yeah,.we each we each can move there when we get our turn.Hm.Yeah.Okay.Okay.We just need to get.So we're just going to move you here.Mhm.with that helicopter card.Alright.Mhm.So it's my turn.Then this one gets us off the island.Yeah.Oh no I have to pick um.Flood?.I have to finish my turn.Oh right.Oh gosh. I forgot about--.And here's the issue. See.Now they're gonna flood.Yes water's rising.Great.(Four) and.shuffle.Great.But it's okay cause we're all next to it so we can all just shore it up.And I have a sandbag. All we even need is.Is this one. And this one to stay afloat. Well not even. No we're fine.Yeah.Right.Yeah if it sinks we can swim.Go. Yeah. (That's your action).Alright. Misty Marsh.Which would kind of be ideal.Misty Marsh.And that goes.It's gone.Gone.Coral Place.Ew.Okay.It's gonna flood.Oh is that where we are.Okay.Yeah.Yup.But that's okay cause it can be shored.Howling Garden.gone. And Whispering Garden.Okay. Flood.This one's useless now.Okay.My turn is done.Uh so it's my turn.Mhm yeah it's your turn.So now it's my turn and I'll shore this up.Okay.Thank you.And I will move here.Alright.And I've got.doesn't matter.I have.three.Temple of the Moon.Four. We're up to four unfortunately.Oh four.Temple of the Moon I got on.Gosh.Oh jeez.Cave of Shadows.Silver Gate.Gone.And Observatory.Gone.Okay. I can't believe we made it to you.Hm.Okay Pilot. Oh my gosh. We're doing this.Okay um. Is this here? Do you guys think I should shore this up just in case?.No because if this one sinks, you can swim.If oh yeah yeah yeah it doesn't matter.Well--.Okay.So you're gonna fly yoursel-- you're gonna.You might as well.Yeah I can fly.If you have three then yeah.here.You'll fly us all over to Flood Landing.Well I have three I can just flood it I mean I can shore it. It doesn't matter.Okay.It doesn't really matter. Might as well.It doesn't matter.Yeah okay.So I'm gonna go here.and that's it.Wait can't you fly.No she can't. She can only fly herself anywhere.Hm.Oh that's right she can only fly herself anywhere. I'm sorry I keep forgetting that.Hm.Uh I have two helicopters!.Okay now you can.Oh oh.Okay I'm going to use this.use it.Fly both of you guys here and I'm going to use it and we all go away.Yes!.And we're done.Yay!
